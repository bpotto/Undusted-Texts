<h1>The Life of Gildas (c. 500 - 570)</h1>
<h2>By Caradoc of Llancarfan (12th c.)</h2>
<h4>Feast Day: January 29</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">St. Gildas was a British monk, born in what is now Scotland, along the River Clyde.  After being educated, possibly by St. Illtud (6th c.) at Cor Tewdws ("College of Theodosius"), he became a monk, establishing churches and monasteries throughout the Britain, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.  Later, after a pilgrimage to Rome, he travelled to Brittany, where he lived the rest of his life, founding a monastery at Rhuys and writing.  His most famous work is <i>De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae</i> (<i>On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain</i>), describing history of Britain from Roman times to the present.  It is the only significant historical work for the period written by a near contemporary.  Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> drew from it heavily.  It is particularly well-known for its description of the Battle of Mount Badon, later described as one of King Arthur's major battles; Gildas, though, does not mention Arthur, and he claims to have been born the same year as the battle, thus being closely contemporary.  Though being Scottish in origin and dying in France, Gildas is most well-regarded among the Welsh, as much of his work occurred there.</p>
<p>There are two main lives of St. Gildas.  The earlier one, from the 9th century, was written by an anonymous monk of Rhuys, at the monastery where Gildas ended his days.  It is long, detailing Gildas' studies with St. Illtud and his work in Ireland, and, of course, emphasizing Gildas' work in Brittany.  The second life, translated below, is by Welsh cleric Caradoc (or Caradog) of Llancarfan, from the 12th century.  He was a friend of Geoffry of Monmouth (c. 1095 - c. 1155), author of a famous <i>History of the Kings of Britain</i>, one of the earliest sources for Arthurian mythology; besides the <i>Life</i> of Gildas and another of Cadoc (or Cadog), another Welsh saint, Caradoc is also claiemd to have written a continuation of Monmouth's work.  Caradoc's life emphasizes Gildas' ties to Wales, and it also connects him to Arthurian mythology, having Gildas meet King Arthur and forgive him for slaying one of Gildas' evil brothers.  The <i>Life</i> also includes the first mention of Meligaunt (here Melwas), an Arthurian villain who kidnapped Queen Guinevere.</p>
<h2>The Life of Gildas</h2>
<ol>
<li>Nau<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup> was the King of the Scots, the noblest kingdom of the North, who had 24 sons, victorious in war, of whom one was named Gildas, whom his parents committed to the study of letters.  The boy flourished in good nature and studious genius; whatever he heard from a teacher, he remembered most diligently, lest oblivion thwart it.  The studious one studied assiduously among the oracles of the seven arts, until he came to youth, when, having become a youth, he quickly deserted the region.</li>
<li>He crossed the Gallic Sea, he remained in the cities of Gaul, studying best, for the span of 7 years, and, at the end of the seventh year, with a great heap of diverse volumes, he returned to Great Britain.  Having heard tell of <i>his</i> most famous arrival, many scholars flocked to him from every place; they heard from him, most subtly, the knowledge of the 7 disciplines, whence, from disciples, they became teachers, under the teacher’s honor.</li>
<li>The religion of the wisest doctor was so much magnified and lauded by all Britons, that none equal to him was found, nor could be found, because of his excellent merits.  He fasted like the hermit Anthony; he prayed, a most religious man, girt with a cilice; whatever was given him, he continuously gave to the poor.  He abstained from milk’s sweetness and from honey, meat was odious to him; instead, in love, he ate spring-side herbs [<i>fontanae herbae</i>] and barley bread mixed with ashes, he drank spring water daily, he did not enter the bath, which was most loved by his people.  His face appeared lean, like how someone gravely ill with a fever looks.  He was wont to enter the river water in the middle of the night, where he stayed steady, while he said the Lord’s Prayer thrice.  Having done this, he repaired to his oratory, where he pleaded, on bent knee, to the Divine Majesty, until clear day.  He slept a little, he fell upon a stone dressed in a single vestment only, he ate without saturation; yet satiated in harvesting the heavenly prizes; celestial prizes were his desire.</li>
<li>He commanded to spurn, he admonished to despise, what passes in a moment: he was the clearest preacher in the three kingdoms of Britain; kings feared the fearful one, whom they obeyed, having heard his acceptable preaching.  He preached every Sunday in the Seaside Church [<i>apud Maritimam ecclesiam</i>], which stood in the region of Pebidiog,<sup><a name='ref.2' href='#ftn.2' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a></sup> in the time of Trifinus the King, with an innumerable multitude of people listening to him: and when he began to preach, the voice of the preaching was restrained in preaching, while the people strongly admired the admirable restraint.  Saint Gildas, finding this out, commanded all the bystanders to depart, so that he could know whether there was an impediment to the Divine preaching through any of them, or if, after their departure, he could preach.  He asked later, if any man or woman was hidden in the church, to which the pregnant Nonnita, future mother of the most holy boy David,<sup><a name='ref.3' href='#ftn.3' class='no_buttons'>[3]</a></sup> responded, “I, Nonnita, remain here between the wall and the door, not wanting to enter the crowd.”  Having heard this, he commanded her to leave, and, after she left, he called the people, who, being called, came to listen to the Evangelic preaching.  After ending the sermon, he asked the angel of God about the aforesaid matter, namely, for what cause he began to preach, and could not proceed to the end.  And he revealed to him, saying thus, “Nonnita, the holy woman, remained in the church, who, now pregnant, will bear a boy with immense grace, because of whom I could not preach, the divine power restraining the speech.  The boy will come to be of greater grace: no one will equal him in your parts.  I relinquish this region to him, he will quickly grow and flourish from age to age.  For the angel of God, the herald, declared this true destiny to me.”</li>
<li>Whence it happened that the most holy preacher Gildas crossed over to Ireland, where he converted innumerable people to the Catholic faith.  The most holy man Gildas was contemporaneous with Arthur, the King of all Great Britain, whom he loved as loveable, whom he always desired to obey.  Yet <i>his</i> twenty-three co-brothers resisted the aforesaid king in rebellion, not wanting to suffer his dominion, but frequently put <i>him</i> to flight and expelled <i>him</i> with assault and war.  Hueil, the eldest, an assiduous fighter and most famous soldier, obeyed no king, not even Arthur.  They afflicted him, he aroused greatest furor among them.  From Scotland, he came most frequently, set up blazes, led away spoils with victory and praise.  Whence the king of all Britain, hearing the magnanimous youth to have done such things and to do equal, pursued the most victorious and best youth, so that the natives affirmed <i>him</i> and hoped <i>for him to be</i> the future king.  But in pursuing the hostile and in the meeting of battle, on the island of Môn,<sup><a name='ref.4' href='#ftn.4' class='no_buttons'>[4]</a></sup> he slew the predator youth.  After that slaying, Arthur the victor returned, rejoicing most greatly, since he had overcome his strongest enemy.  Gildas, the historiographer of the Britons, then remaining in Ireland, directing studies and preaching in the city of Armagh, heard that his brother was slain by Arthur the king.  He sorrowed from the hearing, wept with sobs, as a most beloved brother for a most beloved brother; he prayed for <i>his</i> brother’s spirit daily, he prayed also for Arthur, the pursuer and slayer of his brother, fulfilling the Apostolic precept, <i>Pray for your persecutors and do good to those who hate  you</i> (Mt 5:44).</li>
<li>Thereafter, the most holy Gildas, the venerable historiographer, came to Britain bearing a most beautiful and sweetest bell, which he vowed to offer to the Apostolic <i>Successor</i> of the Roman Church as a present.  He spent the night honorably, received by Cadoc, the venerable abbot in Carban Valley,<sup><a name='ref.5' href='#ftn.5' class='no_buttons'>[5]</a></sup> to whom he showed the laudable bell; he received a demonstration, having received, wanted to buy, at a great price, that which the possessor did not want to sell.  The advent of Gildas the Wise having been heard of by King Arthur and the primates, bishops, and abbots of all Britain, innumerable ones from among the clerics and people gathered together, so that they would make peace with Arthur for the aforesaid homicide.  And he, as he did before, having heard rumor of the death of <i>his</i> brother, was tender towards the enemy, gave pardon to the one offering a kiss, blessed the kisser with a most benignant soul.  This being done, King Arthur, sorrowing and crying, received penitence from the bystanding bishops and emended <i>his life</i> inasmuch as he could, until he ended <i>his</i> life.</li>
<li>Thence the distinguished Gildas, a peaceful and catholic man, went to Rome, and gave to the Apostolic <i>Successor</i> of the Roman Church the aforesaid bell which, moved by the hands of the apostolic <i>successor</i>, emitted no sound.  Whence he, seeing such things, said, “O man loved by God and by man, reveal to me what happened to you on the journey for this presentation.”  And he revealed that the most holy Cadoc, abbot of the church of Nancarban, wanted to buy it, but what he vowed to offer to Saint Peter the apostle, he did not want to sell.  The apostolic successor, having heard this, said, “I know Cadoc the venerable abbot, who came to this city seven times, and thrice to Jerusalem, after immense danger and assiduous labor; him having returned and desiring to have it, I concede you to give it to <i>him</i>.  For it is destined for him, as is held by this present miracle.”  Therefore Gildas received the blessed bell and returned, and, having brought it back, he gave it freely to Saint Cadoc.  Receiving blows from the abbot’s hands, it intoned at once, all admiring.  Whence it remained as a refuge for all bearers through all Wales, and whoever illicitly swore by it was either deprived of the tongue’s office, or the malefactor would immediately confess his injury.</li>
<li>Cadoc, the abbot of the church of Nancarban, prayed Gildas the doctor that he would direct the studies of the schools for a year’s space, and, being prayed, he directed most usefully, receiving no wage from the scholars except the prayers of the clerics and scholars.  There he himself wrote the work of the four Evangelists, which still remains in the Church of Saint Cadoc, worked over everywhere with gold and silver, for the honor of God and the most holy Scripture and the Gospels.  The native Welshmen held that most precious volume in their oaths, nor dare to open it to look; nor do they confirm peace and friendship between enemies, unless that be placed there first.</li>
<li>The year’s span being ended, and the scholars returning from study, the holy abbot Cadoc and Gildas the best doctor, by common counsel, went to two islands, namely Rhonech and Echni.<sup><a name='ref.6' href='#ftn.6' class='no_buttons'>[6]</a></sup>  Cadoc entered the one nearer to Wales, Gildas the one adjacent to England.<sup><a name='ref.7' href='#ftn.7' class='no_buttons'>[7]</a></sup>  They did not want to be impeded in the ecclesiastic office by a gathering of men, therefore, they knew no better counsel than relinquishing Carban Valley and going to an island in secret.  Gildas founded an oratory in honor of the holy and indivisible Trinity, and, near it, his cubicle; yet his bed was not in it, but placed under a high cliff, where he lay until midnight, keeping vigil and praying on a stone to the omnipotent God.  Then he went to the church, excessively frigid; the cold was sweet to him and tolerable for God.  He drew little fish in a met and eggs from the nests of birds, whence he lived, which sufficed for his food.  One visited the other; such living lasted for the space of seven years.</li>
<li>The Highest Creator, seeing His beloved servant Gildas lacking durable water beside raindrops, which fell upon the boulders and which, falling, they held, made a brook flow from a high cliff, which flowed and flows and will remain without any defense.  While Saint Gildas thus persevered, intent in fasts and prayers, pirates came from the Orkney Islands, who afflicted him, stole his familiar servants from him, and led <i>them</i> into exile, with the spoils and all his dwelling’s furnishings.  Whence, so much afflicted that he could not dwell there longer, he relinquished the island, ascended a boat, and entered Glastonbury with great sorrow, Melwas the king reigning in the Summer Region.<sup><a name='ref.8' href='#ftn.8' class='no_buttons'>[8]</a></sup>  The man to be received having been received by the abbot of Glastonbury, he taught his confreres and diverse peoples, sowing the seed to be sown of celestial doctrine.  There he wrote the histories of the kings of Britain.  Glastonbury, that is, ‘Glass City,’ which name it took from glass, is a city first named in the British tongue.  Therefore, it was besieged by Arthur the tyrant, with an innumerable multitude, because of Guinevere his wife, violated and abducted by the aforesaid iniquitous king, and led there, because of the refuge of an inviolable place, because of the hedges of reed, river, and marsh, because of the protection.  The rebellious king had sought the queen for the course of a whole year, he finally heard of her remaining <i>there</i>.  There he moved the army of all Cornwall and Devonshire; prepared was the war among enemies.</li>
<li>Having seen this, the abbot of Glastonbury, accompanied by a cleric and seizing Gildas, entered into the midst of the battle-lines, counseled Melwas his king peaceful, that he would returned the abducted woman; therefore, she who was to be returned, was returned, through peace and benevolence.  These things done, the two kings lavished on the abbot many territories, who came to the temple of the Holy Mary to visit and pray, the abbot confirming the beloved brotherhood because of the abiding peace and the benefits which they gave, and which they were to give more.  Whence the kings returned pacified, promising to reverently obey the most reverend abbot of Glastonbury, and to never violate the most holy place, nor even the places adjoining the chief place.</li>
<li>Having the permission of the abbot of Glastonbury, the clerics, and the people, the most religious Gildas desired to lead an eremitic way of life on the bank of the river near Glastonbury, and he fulfilled <i>his</i> will in deed.  There he built a church in the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity, in which he fasted and prayed assiduously, and wearing a cilice, giving an irreprehensible example of good living with religion to all.  Holy men visited him, the one to be visited, from far-away parts of Britain, returned admonished, and retained the heard exhortations and councils with exultation.</li>
<li>Yet he grew old, and, when he was aggrieved with old age, he called for the abbot of Glastonbury, whom he prayed to with great piety so that, at the end of the course of life, he would transfer his body to the abbey of Glastonbury, which he most greatly loved.  The abbot promising to fulfill the prayer worthily and sorrowing because of the things heard and crying exceedingly, the most holy Gildas, grown old, expired, showing an angelic splendor around <i>his</i> fragrant body to many onlookers and an angel in soul to companions.  After the tearful commendation was completed, the lightest body was transferred by <i>his</i> confreres to the abbey, and, with greatest lament and most worthy honor, he was buried in the midst of the pavement of the Church of Holy Mary; whose soul rested, and rests, and will rest in heavenly rest.  Amen.</li>
