<h1>Homily for the Beginning of Lent</h1>
 <h2>By Paulinus of Béziers (fl. c. 418)</h2>
 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p class = "intro">This is one of the texts edited by Cardinal Angelo Mai (1782-1854), a philologist
  skilled in reading palimpsests, where a previous text is wiped off a parchment in order to make room 
  for a new one.  Cardinal Mai could decipher the original texts and printed many collections of otherwise-lost
   ancient texts.  The manuscript only attributes this homily to a "Paulinus"; Cardinal Mai thinks the most 
   likely author is Paulinus of Béziers (fl. c. 418), rather than the more famous St. Paulinus of Nola 
   (354-431), among others.  An interesting element of this Lenten homily is Paulinus' explanation 
   of the resurrected state; based on Christ's death age of 30 (we would now say 33), at the General 
   Resurrection, all will be at age 30, no matter what age they died.</p>
 <h2>Homily for the Beginning of Lent</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>As our Lord Jesus Christ did not permit this world to perish, so He deigned, through the 
 womb of the holy Mary, to come into the world, in order to redeem us.  The Lord did not want 
 to lose our souls; for this He came into the world, in order to redeem the human race: since, 
 if He wanted to lose those souls, He would not have sustained such lashings for us.  See, 
 brethren, with what precious flesh He redeemed us, not with gold, not with silver, not with 
 clothing; but His own blood He poured forth for us.  He left in heaven the thousands of 
 angels, and came to the world to redeem us, and recalled us to His beatitude.  From the 
 heavens He came into a womb, from a womb He came into a crib, from a crib He fled into Egypt.  
 From there He returned among the Jews, <i>and</i> He fasted for forty days and forty nights.  
 Then He came to the Passion.  For us He sustained such mockeries.  The Jews spit upon Him, 
 they whipped Him, they gave <i>Him</i> blows on the face, they placed a crown of thorns upon His 
 head.  For us He hung on the cross between thieves; and, when He was on the cross, they gave 
 Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink.  They pierced nails into His hands and feet.  And 
 the Lord sustained such things for us.  When His body lay in a sepulcher, He proffered His 
 light to hell; and, entering into it, He snatched from there the first man, Adam, who, for 
 five thousand, two hundred, and twenty-eight years, lay there for his faults.  Our Lord Jesus 
 Christ, when He descended into hell, bit it, since He took a part, and left a part; the just 
 He took, the sinners He left there.  From there He led out Adam and the prophets and the 
 patriarchs and all who were held there without cause.</li>
 <li>And you, brethren, consider how many things our Lord sustained for us.  And we, for God, 
 ought to observe these forty days in fasts, in vigils, in prayers, in almsgivings, in patience, 
 in charity, in humility, in purity, in sobriety, in love of God and neighbor: since these forty 
 days are a tenth of the year: and we, in these days, ought to cease from every iniquity; and for 
 those faults, which we committed before, we ought to do penance: since, however much we are 
 sinners, if, with <i>our</i> whole heart, we want to convert to the Lord, and to cease from those 
 faults, and to do penance, in these days we can come to emendation.  As the Lord fasted forty 
 days and forty nights; and Elijah similarly fasted forty days and nights; and Moses fasted 
 on Mount Sinai.  For there are, from the beginning of the Forty until the Paschal solemnity, 
 six weeks, and there are forty-two days, and there are six Sundays.  Removing these Sundays, 
 there do not remain any more than thirty-six <i>days</i> in abstinence.  In these thirty-six days, 
 we can do penance, if we want to return to the Lord.  As the Lord said: "I do not will the 
 death of the sinner, but that He convert and live" (Ez 33:11).  And as the Son of God, Who suffered for us, 
 arose on the third day from the sepulcher, so also we, in likeness of Him, at the age of 30 
 years, all the people, just and sinners, have to arise for the judgment of God.  Every man 
 will die at some age, either an old man or a boy or a baby in the womb of his mother, and 
 <i>even if</i> he will die in the same womb, we will have to arise at the age of 30 years; sinners, 
 so that they will descend, with their flesh, into hell; the just, so that, in their flesh, 
 they can attain the kingdom of God, with Whom they perform good deeds.</li>
