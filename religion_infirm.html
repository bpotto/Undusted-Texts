<h1>Religion is Bountiful to the Infirm</h1>
<h2>By Hugo of Fouilloy (c. 1096-1172)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">Born at Fouilloy, Hugo received an education from Benedictines before 
becoming a religious himself--probably Benedictine.  He began at the priory of St.-Laurent-au-Bois 
while still young, later becoming founding prior of St.-Nicholas-de-Regny in 1332 and 
eventually returning to St.-Laurent as prior in 1152.  There he died, and little else is known of his life.</p>
<p class='intro'>Though biographical information is sparse, we have a number of his writings.  Though 
often overshadowed--or absorbed--by his co-named contemporary, Hugo of St. Victor (1096-1141), 
some still read his works.  Like Hugo of St. Victor and his student Richard of St. Victor (d. 1173), 
Hugo of Fouilloy wrote mystical theology, particularly focusing on mystical allegories.  His most 
well-known work is <i>De avibus</i> (<i>On Birds</i>) which is both a bestiary and a collection of 
moral and mystical treatises about each bird.  Along with the <i>De medicina animae</i> (<i>Of the 
Medicine of the Soul</i>), he is also known for <i>De claustro animae</i> (<i>Of the Cloister of 
the Soul</i>), from which the following selection is taken.  The work describes the soul using the 
allegory of a monastery and its various parts; the first section, though, is on more general 
moral topics and the benefits of religion.  This selection--Book I, Ch. XII--is on how good 
religion is to those who are ill.  It is "bountiful": the Latin word (<i>larga</i>) is connected 
with the French <i>largesse</i>.  I added some paragraph divisions, as the original text had 
this entire chapter as one paragraph.</p>
<h2>Religion is Bountiful to the Infirm</h2>
<p>Religion is bountiful to the infirm.  But there are four types of infirmity.  For there are 
some who are infirm from old age, others, then, from a lesion of members, others from an infirmity
 in recent times, others, then, are detained in continuous languor.  But they are others 
 whose old age is garrulous, irate, full of proverbs, with empty fables, and although their eyes, 
 going blind, darken, although <i>their</i> hand, trembling, ceases to work, although <i>their</i> foot forgets 
 its office, although the whole body and soul begin to curve, yet, as blessed Augustine says in 
 the book <i>On the Twelve Abuses of the World</i>, when he speaks of the irreligious old man, “his heart
 and tongue do not grow old.”<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>  These are those who glory when they do ill, who glory in becoming
 rich, call the prince of the worldly beautiful, not the peace of saints, they want to be called 
 for lawsuits, since they know what came before.  Such accuse Susannah, if you want to praise 
 <i>them</i>, and they praise Jezebel the fornicating woman, and therefore <i>their judgment will return 
 upon their head: and the angel of the Lord will descend and cut them asunder</i> 
 (cf. Dan 13:59).  There are also those who, when they do not see the earth with their eyes, 
 consider heaven with <i>their</i> mind, who, although they stumble with <i>their</i> feet, although they 
 nod with the whole body, yet they do not offend with <i>their</i> tongue, they do not nod in soul, 
 they are silent about noxious things, they narrate what instructs, they support the interior 
 man’s labor, when they cannot support the exterior.  They stand in prayer, they recount all 
 their years in the bitterness of their soul, and, therefore, their youth will be renewed like 
 the eagle’s (cf. Ps 102:5).</p>
 <p>Then, those who have suffered lesion of members or a molestation of their body, or a languor: 
 they, indeed, are carrying an anxiety of the body through illness, they consult the doctor, if 
 they do not immediately get well, they grow angry at the infirmity, they despair of health.  
 But what do I say, brethren, of these?  They do not suffer headache well, and how will 
 they sustain head-torture for Christ?  They fear the whip, and how will they suffer the 
 cutting-off of the head for Christ?  There are others who do not serve the flesh, but will that 
 the flesh serve the spirit, who seek no doctor but Christ, they call out with the prophet: <i>Heal 
 me, Lord, and I will be healed</i> (Jer 17:14): they alone bear their infirmity, since they do not
 disquiet anyone with grievances, they are not querulous, as those of whom we spoke above.  There
 are four things by which the infirm are conquered, namely, by infirmity, by medicine, by food, 
 by order.  By infirmity, therefore, some are conquered, since they bear the weight of infirmity
 unwillingly.  Others, then, are those who are conquered, since they do not want to interfere in
 the brethren’s labor.  By medicine, then, since fraternal charity does not help them, as 
 they say, some are conquered.  Others, since they suffer distance from the Church through their 
 infirmity, are saddened.  But of food some make a grievance, that it is not ministered to them 
 sufficiently or how or when they want <i>it</i>.  Others, then, suffer since they eat delicate things,
 doing nothing, and since someone serves them and they serve no one.</p>
 <p>But by order some are conquered, imputing to a heavy order the cause of their infirmity, 
 and so, since they fulfilled <i>it</i> well, they waste away evilly.  But there are others who, 
 therefore, are conquered by order, since, separated from the convent of brethren, they are 
 treated more delicately.  But if, from the bed, they hear the psalming voices of brethren in 
 choir, then they ruminate the psalms, praying in the cubicle of the heart, with closed 
 doors: and, although they spend the whole night in vigil, agitated by their pains, yet they 
 judge those blessed who, through part of the night, labor, serving God.  They do not leave the 
 bed willingly: and yet those who handle the tedium of the cloister well, they consider to be 
 happy, they think nothing of fulfilling the order; but, unless I am wrong, they fulfill all.  
 They are crushed together in the cloister of infirmity, they are disciplined by the rod of 
 anxieties and the thorns of pains; they fast, they keep vigil, they labor; since infirmity 
 denies food, sleep, quiet: and yet, if the bed is prepared smoothly, if they think of sleeping 
 without shoes, as if they did something criminal, they fear perishing in such a life.  Such are 
 indignant at consolation, lest they fail through molestation of the body or affliction of the 
 interior man.  Let them hear what the angel says to Peter: <i>Gird yourself, and put on 
 your shoes</i> (Acts 12:8).  Whence Bede, on the Acts of the Apostles: “Peter,” he says, “loosened
 the ties of <i>his</i> tunic because of the rigor of the prison at <i>that</i> hour, so that, the tunic, 
 lowered around <i>his</i> feet, would temper the cold of that night, showing an example to the infirm,
 that, when we are tempted by a bodily molestation or human injuries, it is licit for us to relax 
 some of our proposed rigor.”<sup><a name='ref.2' href='#ftn.2' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a></sup>   Therefore, let them use the counsel of the wise, lest they fail, for 
 <i>these things</i> were written for our instruction.  These are those of diverse infirmities, as we said; now,
 how religion is bountiful to the infirm, let us briefly show.  Blessed Benedict says: “Above all
 and before all, the care of the infirm is to be performed.”<sup><a name='ref.3' href='#ftn.3' class='no_buttons'>[3]</a></sup>  Behold how bountiful 
 religion is to the infirm.  “Before all” he says: that is, more quickly than something for all
 the other brethren ought the infirm brother be provided with what he asks for.  “Above all,” 
 that is, more abundantly than the rest, so that, if necessities are lacking for the others, more
 and more delicate things are sought for the infirm; more, so that, out of many, something may 
 please <i>them</i>, more delicate, so that, when they eat, they may be refreshed by something.</p>
 <p class ="source"><b>Footnotes:</b> <a name='ftn.1' href='#ref.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a>There 
 is a book attributed to St. Augustine <i>On the Twelve Grades of Abuse</i>, and Grade II is on “the 
 old man without religion”; the closest thing to what Hugo quotes is, “Therefore, two particular 
 parts of man are to be heeded, which do not grow old in his flesh, and draw the whole man with 
 them to sin, namely, the heart and the tongue” (PL 40:1080).  Migne’s edition also extends the 
 quote to cover the next sentence, but I cannot find anything similar in the work attributed to 
 Augustine.</p>
