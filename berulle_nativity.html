<h1>On the Nativity of Jesus</h1>
<h2>By Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle (1575-1629)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle was born in 1575 near Champagne.  Educated by Jesuits, 
he attended the Sorbonne in Paris and was ordained in 1599.  With the help of his cousin, Bl. Marie 
of the Incarnation, he introduced the Discalced Carmelites into France, following the reform of St. 
Teresa de Ávila.  He became spiritual director of St. Vincent de Paul and friends with St. Francis de 
Sales.  In 1611, he founded the Oratory of Jesus (see <a href="humani_generis.html" class = "no_buttons">
"Humani generis / Cessent suspiria"</a>).  Along with his religious work, he was also a statesman, 
assisting King Henry IV and King Louis XIII.  He became a cardinal in 1627, but died in 1629 before 
receiving the red hat.  The below text is from his collection <i>Works of Piety</i>, #38.</p>
<h2>On the Nativity of Jesus</h2>
<ol>
<li>He Who has made times and Who is the king of the ages, has willed to render Himself 
subject to time, and to guide the course of His life by the law of time.  And this is the first 
law, subjection, and servitude to which we find the only-begotten Son of God subject in the world.
  This is also the first which He commands us, for we are temporal; our being is temporal, and 
  we are subject to time.  We are born when the course of nature bears it, for we are slaves of 
  time.  From the 25th of March, when the Son of God is conceived, until the 25th of December, 
  the course of nine months deputed by nature to the progress of the infant in the womb of its 
  mother is entirely accomplished.  And the only-begotten Son of God has willed to suffer this 
  law of nature, without abridging it for a single moment, although He had begun forty days 
  earlier to be organized and animated in the womb of the Virgin.   For He employs His power 
  and His marvels to redeem us, but not to redeem Himself from the law of our infirmities.  
  The evangelist, thus, teaches us: <i>Impleti sunt dies ut pareret [The days were fulfilled so 
  that she would give birth]</i> (Lk 2:6), that the days ordained by nature for the birth were 
  fulfilled, and, through the plenitude of this course of nature, he elevates us, tacitly, 
  to revere the plenitude of the time celebrated in Scripture, where time produces the Eternal, 
  the creature its Creator, and the Virgin her God and her only-begotten Son all together.</li>
  <li>This plenitude of time elevates us to another sort of plenitude given to nature.  
  For the Virgin has received plenitude of grace to conceive Jesus; she has also received
  plenitude of grace to bear Jesus, for the author of grace cannot be conceived or born 
  except through plenitude of grace, of power, and of marvel.  It is nature which bears grace,
  as it is the creature which bears the Creator.  For Jesus is the grace of the Father, 
  essential and not accidental grace, essential and personal grace, uncreated and incarnate 
  grace, grace and source of grace which fight on earth and triumph in heaven.  This grace 
  is born through nature, Jesus through Mary, through Mary, I say, and through the nature 
  elevated, accomplished, and animated by a new state and effort of grace, worthy to produce 
  the Son of God in the world.</li>
  <li>We do not abase our spirits in the simple condition of human births, when we 
  intend to say that the Virgin bears her only-begotten Son in the world.  This Son is God 
  and man, and joins in His being two very different conditions, and He also joins in these 
  states and mystery the grandeurs and the abasements conformed to the different qualities of 
  these two natures.  And these grandeurs are given unto His Mother, for the grandeurs of the 
  Son and of the Mother are joined together in this mystery of the Son and of the Mother.  He 
  is an infant, but He is God.  She is mother of an infant, but she is Mother of a God, Mother
  of the Creator, Mother of the Savior of the world.  She is Mother and Virgin, Jesus born of 
  her and without effort of nature, through the sweet effort of His power, and through the divine
  power which He communicates to His Mother, who produces Him as a God in the world.  If a God 
  ought to be born, He ought to be born thus: without impurity, without effort, without damage
  to her who bears Him in the world, as He has been conceived in her without any accident 
  contaminating the purity and the virginity of her who is His Mother, Mother and Virgin all 
  together.  Mother and Virgin in conceiving Him, Mother and Virgin in bearing Him.  Since 
  He wills that nature produce Him, He does not will to give a lesser condition to His Mother, 
  producing a God, that that which He has Himself given to nature to bear inanimate things.  
  He is the flower of Israel; nature produces flowers without the work of the tree which bears
  them.  He is the light of the universe; the light departs from the sun through an emanation 
  so living, so sweet, so eminent, that, in a moment, it penetrates from heaven to earth without 
  effort, without work in the transparent bodies through which it arrives to us.<br />
  But let us speak more highly of He Who passes nature, and Who is the God of nature itself.  
  Jesus is the Son of the Father, and He proceeds from the paternal bosom without work, that
  bosom remaining eternally closed, notwithstanding that procession and mission of the Son of 
  God to the world; and He wills also to proceed from the virginal womb of His holy Mother, that 
  womb remaining closed as before, figured by the garden closed and the fountain sealed (cf. Sgs 4:12), 
  and by the eastern gate through which God passes (cf. Ez 44:1-3).</li>
  <li>As this birth is admirable, the causes, also, of this birth are divine and admirable,
  and the Virgin receives a divine power to produce her Son in the world.  The power of the 
  Most High surrounds her as in her conception, and the desire of the Father to give His Son 
  to the world is communicated to her heart, and this maternal and virginal heart, joined to 
  the will and to the power to give her Son to the world, is found powerful, but with a divine 
  power, to produce a God upon earth.   O power! O grandeur! O dignity of the Virgin, 
  conceiving and producing a God in the world!  If God ought to be conceived, He ought to 
  be conceived thus; if God ought to be born, He ought to be born thus.  How the grandeurs 
  and the marvels of this birth surpass the basenesses of this birth; for, so the grandeurs 
  of the divine nature surpass the basenesses of the human nature of this Child-God.  But 
  His grandeurs and marvels are interior and invisible, and His abasements are visible and 
  sensible; for so the divine nature of this child is invisible, and His human nature is 
  sensible.  Let us contemplate both His grandeurs and His abasements, let us adore both His 
  abasements and His grandeurs: for the one and the other is divine, for the one and the other 
  is ours.  Let us exercise our faith over the one, and our senses over the other; but let us 
  exercise our senses through the guidance of the faith, and through the light of grace.  But 
  let us see the state and the progress of this birth, let us go to Bethlehem, let us go to the 
  stable.  Let us see Jesus, an infant, let us see Mary, His mother, and Joseph assisting and 
  servant the Mother and the infant.  Let us see the stable, and the cow, and the ass, and the 
  grandeur of heaven and of earth abased in Bethlehem in the person of the Son, and in the 
  person, also, of the Mother.</li>
  <li>V.	The Virgin departs from Nazareth, and goes to Bethlehem by an ordinance of the emperor; Jesus, 
  from then commencing to obey the monarch of earth, commenced to obey, first, that of birth.  
  For He dies on a cross through obedience; He wills, also, to be born in a Bethlehem through 
  obedience; and a thing so divine as the birth of Jesus in the world seems to arrive through a 
  human situation; but God hides and guides His providence in human things, and we have to admire 
  that the highest and rarest providence which God exercises over His only-begotten Son is tempered,
  covered, and guided, and as if abased in human situations.  What is more divine in the universe 
  than the birth of Jesus in the universe?  Which is it which ought to be more guided by a 
  Providence all divine and high, though abased in human things?  And it does not seem that God 
  mixes Himself, and [that] this is guided by the strong will of a prince, who wills to know the 
  forces of his empire, this is regulated by the governors of the provinces, who publish the 
  ordinances at once or tardily as it pleases them, this is regulated by the executors of this 
  ordinance, and a thousand other accidents which occur in similar things.  Jesus is born in a 
  stable, and not in a common house; Jesus is in a crèche, and not in a crib, which is the first 
  sojourn of infants; Jesus is born in the midst of the cow and of the ass, and not in the midst 
  of His parents, and His first company is the cow and the ass; and in this abasement is found 
  the miraculous birth of Him Who has made heaven and earth.  It is not for us to speak of this 
  mystery, and we have more to admire and adore it by a profound silence, than to profane it and
  make it vile [by] our too feeble thoughts.  Jesus is an infant and in the obligation to silence,
  He cannot speak to us; it would be for the Virgin and for the angel serving Jesus to speak to 
  us.<br />
  God, Who has thus abased His Son on earth in a stable, wants to elevate Him to heaven, 
  and from heaven He sends His angels to adore Him, from heaven He sends His angels to announce
  Him, from heaven He sends a star to publish to the magi His birth.  These are the three 
  miracles which heaven contributes to Jesus born an infant on earth, while earth is in 
  forgetfulness and ignorance of its savior: <i>Et adorent eum omnes angeli ejus [And let all 
  His angels adore Him]</i> (Heb 1:6).</li>
