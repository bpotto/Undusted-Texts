<h1>Welcome to <i>Undusted Texts</i>!</h1>
<p><center>A book just in Babel,<br />a prop for the table.</center></p>
<p></p>
<p>Unless a work is in a language that is read, the work will not be read.  Of course, 
some people do read the languages translated from here--Koine Greek, Latin, Reniassance
Spanish, etc.--but they are few in number compared to readers of English.  Thus, to make
these works more accessible, I have decided to translate them into a more accessible
language.</p>
<p>My hope is that, by these translations, the words of Christians of times
past will become present for us today.  The translations will focus on styles of works
less frequently translated.  Instead of the great theological treatises, here are the more
popular-level works--saints' lives and homilies--as well as poems, an often-ignored
category.  May these translations, the dust of the past shaken off, connect us
with our Christian brethren of the past.</p>
