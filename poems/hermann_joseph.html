<h1>"Jubilus of Our Lord Jesus Christ"</h1>
<h2>By St. Hermann Joseph (c. 1150 - 1241)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">St. Hermann Joseph was born in Cologne to noble, yet poor, parents.  From an early age, he was known for his devotion to Mary and was frequently found in the Church of St. Mary on the Capitol, rapt in prayer.  At the age of twelve, he entered the Praemonstratensian (or Norbertine) abbey in Steinfeld.  He was too young to make his vows, so he was sent to the Netherlands for studies, before returning and entering the order.  He often worked in the refectory and sacristry, and was often called upon to make and repair clocks.  Near the end of his life, he became the chaplain for the Cistercian nuns in Hoven; there he died, on April 4, 1241, and was buried, before his relics were moved back to Steinfeld.  Some relics can also be found in Cologne and Antwerp.  His canonization process began in 1626, but it was interrupted; Pope Pius XII, however, confirmed his status as a saint on August 11, 1958.  His main feast day, among Norbertines, is May 24, the date of the translation of his relics; he is also celebrated on April 4, his date of death.</p>
<p class='intro'>St. Herman Joseph wrote a commentary on the Song of Songs, which is, unfortunately, currently lost; however, a number of smaller works have survived.  A collection of prayers is attributed to him, but he was probably better known for his joyful poems, each known as a <i>Jubilus</i>.  There are three major ones: one to St. Ursula and her companions, one to Mary, and one to Jesus.  The poem translated below is the <i>Jubilus</i> to Jesus.  It has a heavy influence from the Song of Songs, as is typical of mystical writing; I have mostly refrained from noting allusions to the Song.</p>

<ol>
<li class = "poems">Jesus sweet and handsome,
Rose fragrant by a wonder,
My spouse so full of loving,
So well-formed beyond measure,
	My most beautiful beloved.
Where, I plead, are You dwelling,
Where live, that I may seek You,
Where do you lie down or rest,
Who taste so and are sweetened,
	O sweet savor of the soul?
</li>
<li class = "poems">Draw me, O my beloved,
bend down my mind to You,
To You I run in fragrance
Fatigued before this love,
	Give a hand, saying: Follow.
See the mind which sees You,
Whose heart smiles at You,
Not a care does it have,
So it could enjoy the lover;
	Stay, my darling, turn back.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Be mine and I’ll be Yours,
Where you sleep, I’m there too,
Be with me on my bed,
When I’m with such a lover,
	Our couch shall be florid.
May our home so lilied
Be delicate with roses,
For our love also is
Full and perfect beautiful,
	Flushed with red and whitened.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Approach, come near, darling,
Dwell alongside the lover,
I’ll not offend You, friend,
Remove whatever’s wicked
	From the midst of my heart.
Every good I hope from You,
In Your heart sincere I joy,
From me, I presume no further,
Whose life is like the smoke,
	You know in me what I don’t know.
</li>
<li class = "poems">So therefore, come, good Jesus,
In my heart rest Yourself,
Be with me in this village,
O beloved, my friend,
	Come so that I feel You.
Now my heart is enwidened
And now in You it delights,
It truly feels You present,
It feels You remain in it,
	It foretastes the sweet grace.
</li>
<li class = "poems">O how sweet this affection
By which my chest now joys,
A fawning love and lenient
Is born now in my veins,
	O thanksgiving of such graces!
Darling, attach to me,
Join everything to me
Embrace the one loving You
And kiss upon my heart;
	O how You’re here today!
</li>
<li class = "poems">O sweetness great of God,
Fill the bosom of my heart,
Sweet love, increase and grow,
Whatever pleases, do,
	Give milk and heap on honey.
Open the cell, flow the wine,
Spring the milk, give honey divine,
Of the torrent of delightfulness
Give freely, for You have enough;
	These things cannot suffice.
</li>
<li class = "poems">You will give all of Yourself,
Give drink from Your own hand,
Your cell I’ll enter with You,
You'll be all there with me,
	To give the sweet wine-goblet.
Give also a taste from the glass
Full of pomegranates’ must,
From the deep bowl of Your heart
Give the first-fruits of the wine
	After goblet, give a kiss.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Now may my heart not be its own,
May it live for You and be Yours;
Be in You and You in it,
That it thus rest with God
	And form a single spirit.
In the conclave of my heart
Speak to me with smooth voice,
My spouse, so beloved,
Singular, pre-elected,
	Whom I love to the marrow.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Give response to the speaker,
Embracing You from the heart,
Within myself You’re speaking
And, as within You’re hearing,
	The heart’s hearing open.
What will You be for me in heavens,
Who will have this so sweetly?
What are You there, king of heavens,
Filling the choirs of angels,
	Who are this to such a pauper?
</li>
<li class = "poems">Where so many crowns do shine,
Sweet Jesus, good Jesus,
There You are so glorious
And copious in everything
	As plentiful in sweetness.
They spend their time in love of You,
Who see You in handsomeness,
To such sweet caressing
After this carnal dressing
	Bring me for Your name’s sake.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Where, before Your visage,
Snatched from the carnal tumult,
I’ll enjoy You by my will,
Satiated in sweet God
	By love individual
My heart languishes and dries,
As long as He does not appear,
Whose arrow has smitten me;
O how good it will be for me,
	When I enjoy You perpetually!
</li>
<li class='poems'>Come now, free me the captive,
That in the age I’ll live with You;
That I love You, ignore not;
Therefore shatter long delays,
	By which, quicker, I shall end.
To the pleasant place of life
Call unto Your Shumanite;<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>
Me, I pray, shall You remember
And for long You shall not wait,
	Or of this love shall I die.
</li>
</ol>

A reference to Song of Songs 6:13: "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee" (KJV).  The Bride is here referred to as being from "Shulem"; that place is otherwise unidentified.  Some scholars link Shulem with Shunem, a village in Issachar's territory; others think it refers to Salem, that is, Jerusalem.</p>
