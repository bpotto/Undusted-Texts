<h1>"Humani generis / Cessent suspiria"</h1>
<h2>By The Oratory of Jesus</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">The Oratory of Jesus was founded by Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle (1575-1629).  
(See <a href="berulle_nativity.html" class = "no_buttons">"On the Nativity of Jesus"</a>
 and <a href="berulle_lifesource.html" class = "no_buttons">"God, Jesus, and Mary are Life and 
 the Source of Life."</a>)  
Famous members include St. John Eudes (1601-1680)--before forming his own congregation--and 
Jean-Jacques Olier (1608-1657).  The French school of spirituality, founded by Bérulle and perpetuated 
by the Oratory, was a major force in the spiritual formation of St. Louis Marie de Montfort  (1673-1716).  
The Oratory is a society of priests, not a traditional religious order, and their emphasis is 
on Jesus and His humility in the Incarnation.  
 Perhaps the greatest text in their tradition is Bérulle's <i>Discourses on the State and on the 
 Grandeur of Jesus</i>.  Below is a hymn for the Feast of the Annunciation, taken from a book of 
 hymns for the use of the Oratory.</p>
 <h2>"Humani generis / Cessent suspiria"</h2>
<ol>
<li class = "poems">Let human race&#8217;s sighs now cease;
Now come blessed tidings of our peace
	In mortal days.
</li>
<li class = "poems">In evil fell we one and all;
The Highest comes from heaven&#8217;s hall	
	The lapsed to raise.
</li>
<li class = "poems">To Virgin loved who God would birth,
The angel preaches myst&#8217;ry worth
	Our salvation.
</li>
<li class = "poems">O blessed among your race, give room!
O Virgin chaste, God in your womb
	Receive as son.
</li>
<li class = "poems">By Spirit&#8217;s strength, in Virgin&#8217;s womb,
One innocent of fallen doom
	To flesh is paired.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Down here as babe you&#82l7;ll nurse the One
Who, as the Bread of minds above,
	Is eaten there.
</li>
<li class = "poems">Who, timeless, from the Father born,
The Word, has mortal body worn
	Thus man to save.
</li>
<li class = "poems">This body raised in sacrifice,
The slaves to free, is all the price,
	In bloody wave.
</li>
<li class = "poems">From homeland wayward wandered I,
by paths unknown, to true delight,
	By which I walked.
</li>
<li class = "poems">To my exile the Lord has come
To be the way and way&#8217;s true home;
	Secure I walk.
</li>
<li class = "poems">O truth in body’s veil concealed,
But to pure body’s eyes revealed,
	Illumine us.
</li>
<li class = "poems">For mercy the Divine you plead;
Though “handmaid of the Lord” decreed,
	Be world’s Mistress.
</li>
</ol>
Amen.
