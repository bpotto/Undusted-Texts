<h1>"The Plea of the Foolish Virgins"</h1>
<h2>By St. Romanos the Melodist (490-556)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">St. Romanos is one of the three main hymn-writers ("hymnographers") of the Byzantine Church, alongside St. John of Damascus (676-749) and his foster-brother, St. Cosmas of Maiuma (8th c.).  Romanos was probably born in Emesa, Syria, possibly with a Jewish background; he served as a deacon at the Church of the Resurrection in Beirut, Lebanon, before moving to Constantinople in the early 500s, during the reign of Patriarch Anastasios I (r. 491-518).  There, he served at the Church of the Theotokos in Kyrou, where he was later buried.  Per legend, on Christmas Eve, he had a dream in which the Virgin gave him a scroll to swallow; when he awoke for the Vigil of the Nativity, he mounted the pulpit and extemporaneously proclaimed his Kontakion on the Nativity.  He wrote many such hymns (some sources claim over a thousand, though only eighty-five surviving ones are attributed to him, and only fifty-nine are considered authentic), and they were so beloved that he was canonized, with his feast celebrated on October 1.</p>
<p class='intro'>He is the first major writer of the <i>kontakion</i> (plural <i>kontakia</i>), a style of long hymn, sometimes described as a sermon in verse.  It consists of a number of stanzas arranged in patterns based on stress, rather than vowel length (as is typical of Greek and Latin poetry), with a shorter introductory stanza.  Each stanza ends with the same, or almost the same, refrain.  Frequently, the kontakion tells a story or includes a dialogue.  In the past, these long hymns were recited at liturgies; in time, though, only the introductory stanza remained, and it was given the name <i>kontakion</i>, under which it now serves as one of the two basic proper hymns of the Byzantine Liturgy, alongside the <i>troparion</i>.  It is thought that the original kontakion form probably derived from the many Syriac styles of metrical homilies, famously practiced by St. Jacob of Serug (451-521).  The most famous of St. Romanos' authentic kontakia is the first one on the Nativity; however, far more well-known is the Akathist, a hymn that is based on the kontakion style and usually attributed to Romanos.</p>
<p class='intro'>The following is an excerpt from one of St. Romanos' two kontakia on the Parable of the Ten Virgins; this parable is one of the main reference points for the Matins services of Holy Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday ("Bridegroom Matins").  After some introductory material on the parable in general, St. Romanos paints the scene and recounts the coming of the Bridegroom and the acceptance of the five wise and prudent virgins.  Then the five foolish virgins come and plead for entrance, which is denied them; the excerpt below consists of their plea and the opening stanza of Christ's response.  Christ's speech to them takes of most of the rest of the kontakion, as he emphasizes the various virtues that they should have practiced in life when they had time to do so, and explaining how rich His mercy is for those who do make an effort for virtue, however little they can give: "Not grave is God's command: for He does not ask / the one who can't to give, but seeks intent" (29.1-2).  The foolish virgins, though, delayed their virtue-seeking too long; after death, there is no chance to go back and do what was left undone.  This is the strict warning St. Romanos gives us here.</p>
 <h2>Kontakion 47: On the Ten Virgins, I</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li class = "poems">As they took the empty road, the five came to the end
	and found the bridal chamber closed by Christ,
	then all cry with anguished voice and sighs and tears:
"Your mankind-loving door, Immortal, open
	to us too, who serve Your might in virginity."
Then the King calls out to them:
	"The Kingdom is not opened unto you;
I know you not; depart, then, from My midst,
	for you don't bear
the incorruptible crown."
</li>
<li class = "poems">Hearing Christ, the King of all, calling to the five,
	"I know not who you are," they're filled with all trouble;
	weeping, they cry out: "Justest Judge, poverty we've kept,
we've exercised all self-control, with eagerness,
	we've kept the fasts; we've made firm non-acquisition;<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>
the flame of fire of lechery
	we've conquered, and the appetites;
we've ever kept a faultless way of life,
	so that we'd gain
the incorruptible crown.
</li>
<li class = "poems">"But with virtues and virginity's grace and the trampling
	of the fire of lust and flame of pleasures,
	with many toils, when the life of those in heaven we've zealed for—
and eager have we been to have the bodiless'<sup><a name='ref.2' href='#ftn.2' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a></sup> way of life—
	these and such, as it so seems, are found honorless,
for we've shown the toil of many a virtue
	and all hope's been shown as vain;
why, then, show You ignorance, Who bestow
	on all You will,
the incorruptible crown?
</li>
<li class = "poems">"Nod, Savior, to us too, only Just Judge; open Your door.
	Bring into the bridal chamber Your virgins, Ransomer,
	and do not turn Your face, O Christ, from those calling You,
that we be not deprived of Your immortal grace,
	nor become shame and reproach before the angels;
do not, then, forever leave us
	standing, Christ, outside Your bridal chamber:
for those before us did not practice purity,
	to whom You grant
the incorruptible crown."
</li>
<li class = "poems">The fools thus saying to the Judge of All, Christ said to them:
	"Now a just and truthful judgment is set forth:
	the mankind-loving season has been closed, now there is no sympathy;
no longer will compassion's door be open unto men,
	since occasion for repentance is not then given them;
no longer sympathetic, the One Compassionate of late,
	but the Merciful is a relentless Judge;
compassionless you showed yourselves within the world;
	how then seek you
the incorruptible crown?"
</li>
</ol>

<p class = 'source'><b>Footnotes:</b> <a name='ftn.1' href='#ref.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a>This term, ἀκτημοσύνη, is often translated as "landlessness," that is, not owning property; one of its roots, though, is the work κτῆμα, meaning "possession."  More literally, then, the term could be translated "possessionlessness."  "Non-acquistion" has some of the same connotation.</p>
<p class='source'><a name='ftn.2' href='#ref.2' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a>In the Greek tradition "the bodiless ones" is a term for the angels.  The monastic and virginal lives were considered to be emulating the life of the angels.</p>
