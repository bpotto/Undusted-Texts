<h1>Of the Virtues of the Name of Jesu</h1>
<h2>By Richard Rolle of Hampole (c. 1290 - 1349)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="intro">Richard was born to a farming family and grew up at Thornton-le-Dale, in England.  
He studied at the University of Oxford but dropped out at age 18 or 19 to become a hermit.  At first, 
he lived with a squire, John Dalton, in Pickering; there he became to have mystical experiences.  
His location after that is unknown, though he most likely lived in Richmondshire or Yorkshire.  In the
 early 1330s, he began writing, in both English and Latin; many works were written to a Yorkshire 
 anchoress, Margaret Kirkby, who was key in establishing his later reputation.  He eventually died 
 at a Cisterican nunnery in Hampole, where he had often helped the nuns in some way, though the 
 details are unclear.</p>
 <p class="intro">Not only was Richard a profuse writer, he also became one of the most-read English 
 writers of the 15th century.  Among his most famous works are the <i>Incendium Amoris</i> (<i>The Fire 
 of Love</i>) and <i>The Form of Living</i>, as well as two <i>Commentaries on the Psalter</i> and
a <i>Commentary on the Readings in the Office 
 of the Dead taken from Job</i>, which was his first work to be published, in 1483.  Along with longer 
 works, he also wrote a number of short treatises.  The below work is listed as one of his treatises, but 
 it appears to actually be a section from his Latin <i>Postilla super canticum canticorum</i> (<i>Notes 
 on the Song of Songs</i>), which only covers the first few verses of the book.  I am not sure if the 
 English translation is Richard's or not.  In my modernization of the Middle English, I strove to keep 
 as much of the original text as possible, which leads to some out-of-use grammatical constructions 
 and words; I also kept the spelling "Jesu" ("Ihesu" in the original text").  Paragraph divisions are 
 my own.</p>
 <h2>Of the Virtues of the Name of Jesu</h2>
 <h3><i>Oleum effusum nomen tuum</i> (Sgs 1:3)</h3>
 <p>That is in English, “Oil out-poured is thy name.”  The name of Jesu comes into the world, and 
 as soon <i>as it comes</i> it smells <i>like</i> oil out-poured.  “Oil” is said, for everlasting salvation is hoped.  
 Soothly,<sup><a name='ref.001' href='#ftn.001' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>  
 “Jesu” means as much as “savior” or “hale-full.”<sup><a name='ref.002' href='#ftn.002' 
 class='no_buttons'>[2]</a></sup> Therefore, what means it, 
 “Oil out-poured is thy name,” but “Jesu is Thy Name”?  This Name is oil out-poured, for Jesu, 
 the Word of God, has taken man’s kind.  Jesu, Thou fulfills in works what Thou is called in name.
 Soothly, <i>Thou</i> saves man, Whom we call savior.  Therefore, Jesu is Thy Name.  Ah!  Ah! that 
 wonderful Name!  Ah! that delightable Name!  This is the Name that is above all names; Name 
 altogether highest, without which no man hopes <i>for</i> hale.  This name is, in mine ear, <i>a</i> heavenly 
 sound, in my mouth, honey-full sweetness.  Wherefore, do not wonder that I love that Name, the 
 which gives comfort to me in all anguish.  I cannot pray, I cannot have mind, without sounding 
 the Name of Jesu.  I savor no joy that with Jesu is not mingled.  Whereso I be, whereso I sit, w
 hatso I do, the mind of the savor of the Name “Jesu” departs not from my mind.  I have set my 
 mind, I have set it like <i>a</i> tokening upon mine arm, for love is strong as death (cf. Sgs 8:6).  
 As death slays all, so love overcomes all.  Everlasting love has overcome me, not for to slay 
 me, but for to quicken me.  But it has wounded me, therefore it should heal me.  It has 
 through-fixed my heart, that it be healed to the marrow.  And now, overcome, I fail.  I hardly 
 live for joy.  Near-at-hand, I die; for I endure not in deliciousest sweetness, and <i>I am</i> ever 
 drunken.  It befalls <i>that</i> the flesh may not, of His virtue, every fail while the soul, in such 
 joys, is ravished for to joy.  But when unto me <i>would come</i> such joy, but for Jesu?  The name of 
 Jesu has taught me for to sing, and has lightened my mind with the heat of unmade light.  
 Therefore I sigh, and cry, “Who shall shew to the loved Jesu, that I languish for love?” (cf. 
 Sgs 2:5)  My flesh has failed, and my heart melts in love, yearning for Jesu.  All the heart, 
 fastened in the yearning <i>for</i> Jesu, is turned into the fire of love; and with the sweetness of 
 the Godhead it is fully filled.</p>
 <p>Therefore—Ah, good Jesu—have mercy on this wretch!  Show Thyself to this languishing <i>one</i>!  
 Be Thou leech<sup><a name='ref.003' href='#ftn.003' class='no_buttons'>[3]</a></sup>
 unto this wounded <i>one</i>!  If Thou come, I am hale, I feel myself, not sick, but 
 languishing for Thy love; late my soul takes breath, seeking Thee, Jesu, Whom it loves; with 
 what love it is taken, <i>Thou</i> Whom only it covets.  Soothly, the mind, touched with the sovereign 
 sweetness, breathes for to wax hot in the love of the Maker, whiles it strains to hold busily 
 within itself the sweetest Name of Jesu.  Soothly, from thence arises a great love; and whatever 
 thing that it truly touches, it ravishes it utterly to it.  It inflames the affection, it binds 
 the thought, yea, and all the man it draws to the service of it.  Soothly, Jesu, desirable is 
 Thy Name, lovable and comfortable.  None such sweet joy may be considered.  None such sweet song
 may be heard.  None such sweet and delightable solace may be had in mind.  Therefore, whatsoever
 thou be, that readies thyself for to love God, if thou will never be dissuaded nor deceived, if 
 thou will be wise and not unwise, if thou will stand and not fall, have in mind, busily, for to
 hold the Name of Jesu in thy mind; and then thine enemy shall fall and thou shall stand; thine 
 enemy shall be made wake, thou shall be made strange.  And if thou will loyally do this, far 
 from dread, thou shall be a glorious and lovable overcomer.</p>
 <p>Seek, therefore, the Name of Jesu, and hold it, and forget it not.  Soothly, nothing slackens 
 such fell flames, destroys ill thoughts, puts out venomous affections, does away with curious 
 and vain occupations from us.  This Name Jesu, loyally held in mind, draws <i>out</i> vices by the root,
 sets virtues, in-laws charity, in-sets savor of heavenly things, wastes discord, reforms peace, 
 gives indwelling rest, does away <i>with the</i> grievousness of fleshly desires, turns all earthly 
 thing to annoyance, fills the lover with ghostly joy.  So that it may well be said, <i>“Et 
 gloriabuntur omnes qui deligunt nomen tuum, quoniam tu benedices iusto,”</i> that is, “All shall 
 joy, that loves Thy Name, for Thou shall bless the righteous” (Ps 5:12-13).  Therefore, the 
 righteous has deserved to be blessed, if the Name of Jesu truly he has loved; and therefore, 
 <i>he is</i> called righteous, for he constrained himself truly to love Jesu.  Wherefore, what may 
 befall unto him that unceasingly covets for to love the Name of Jesu?  Soothly, he loves, and 
 he yearns for to love, for we have known that the love of God stands in such manner that, 
 inasmuch as we may love, the more we long for to love.  Wherefore it is said, <i>“Qui edunt me 
 adhuc esurient, et qui bibunt me adhuc sciciunt?”</i>, that is to say, “<i>They</i> that eat Me, they 
 hunger yet; and they that drink me, they thirst yet” (Sir 24:29).  Therefore, by itself, 
 delightable and covetable is the Name of Jesu, and the love of it.  Therefore, joy shall not 
 fail unto him that covets busily for to love Him Whom angels yearn for to behold.  Angels ever 
 see, and ever they yearn for to see; and so are they filled, that their filling does not <i>take</i> 
 away their desire, and so <i>they desire that</i><sup><a name='ref.004' href='#ftn.004' 
 class='no_buttons'>[4]</a></sup> their desire does not take away their filling.  This 
 is full joy, this is endless joy, this is glorious joy, the which the filled uses lastingly 
 without annoyance; and if we use it, we shall be filled ever without lessening.  Therefore, 
 Jesu, all shall joy that loves Thy Name.  Soothly, they shall joy now, by <i>the</i> in-setting of 
 grace, and, in time to come, by sight of joy, and therefore they shall joy, because joy comes 
 of love.  Therefore, he that loves not, he shall ever more be without joy.  Therefore, many 
 wretches of the world, trusting themselves to joy with Christ,
<sup><a name='ref.005' href='#ftn.005' class='no_buttons'>[5]</a></sup> shall sorrow without end.  
 And why?  For they loved not the Name of Jesu.  Whatso ye<sup><a name='ref.006' href='#ftn.006' 
 class='no_buttons'>[6]</a></sup> do, if ye give all that ye have unto 
 the needy, but ye love not the Name of Jesu, ye travail in vain.  As only they may joy in Jesu 
 that love Him in this life; and they that fill themselves with vices and venomous delights do 
 not dread that they are put out of joy.  Also, all wit that the Name of Jesu is hale-full, 
 fruitful, and glorious.</p>
 <p>Therefore, who shall have hale that loves it not, or who shall bear the fruit before Christ 
 that has not the flower?  And joy shall he not see, that, joying, loved not the Name of Jesu. 
 The wicked shall be done away, that he see not the joy of God.  Soothly, the righteous seeks 
 the joy and the life, and they find it in Jesu, Whom they loved.  I went about by coveting of 
 riches, and I found not Jesu.  I sat in companies of worldly mirth, and I found not Jesu.  In 
 all there, I sought Jesu, but I found Him not, for He let me wit,<sup><a name='ref.007' href='#ftn.007' 
 class='no_buttons'>[7]</a></sup>  by His grace, that He is not 
 found in the land of soft living.  Therefore, I turned by another way, and I ran about by poverty,
 and I found Jesu, pure born in the world, laid in a crib and lapped in clothes.  I went by 
 suffering of weariness, and I found Jesu weary in the way, tormented with hunger, thirst, and 
 cold, filled with reproofs and blames.  I sat by myself, fleeing the vanities of the world, and 
 I found Jesu in <i>the</i> desert, fasting on the mount, praying alone.  I ran by the pain of penance, 
 and I found Jesu bound, scourged, given gall to drink, nailed to the Cross, hanging on the Cross,
 and dying on the Cross.  Therefore, Jesus is not found in riches, but in poverty; not in 
 delights, but in penance; not in wanton joying, but in bitter grating; not among many, but in 
 only-ness.  Soothly, an evil man finds not Jesu, for, where He is, he seeks Him not.  He 
 constrains himself to seek Jesu in the joy of the world, where never He shall be found.  
 Soothly, therefore, the Name of Jesu is hale-full, and needs behooves be loved by all coveting 
 salvation.  He covets well his salvation that keeps busily in himself the Name of Jesu.  
 Soothly, I have no wonder if the tempted fall, that puts not the Name of Jesu in lasting mind. 
 Securely only may he or she choose to live, that has chosen the Name of Jesu especially, for 
 there may no wicked spirit annoy, where Jesu is much in mind or is named in mouth, etc.

 “Sooth” means “truth,” as in the old phrase, “for sooth!”</p>
 <p class='source'><a name='ftn.002' href='#ref.002' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a>
  Hale” is an older English world for “health,” originally spelled “hele” or “hael,” where one can see the connection to “heal.”  
  There are also connections to “whole.”</p>
 <p class='source'><a name='ftn.003' href='#ref.003' class='no_buttons'>[3]</a> 
   The term “leech” could mean “doctor” in older English usage.</p>
 <p class='source'><a name='ftn.004' href='#ref.004' class='no_buttons'>[4]</a> 
	The editor’s notes interpolate this phrase, found in the original Latin, but not in the Middle English translation.</p>
<p class='source'><a name='ftn.005' href='#ref.005' class='no_buttons'>[5]</a> 
	 That is, trusting that they would have joy with Him in eternity.</p>

In Middle English, “ye” is the second-person plural, as opposed to “thou,” the second-person 
singular.  “You” was a form of “ye,” but it later became used as a formal singular.</p>
<p class='source'><a name='ftn.007' href='#ref.007' class='no_buttons'>[7]</a> 
“To wit” means “to know,” and the verb was very commonly used in older English.  
Occasionally one still hears the phrase “to wit” as analogous to “that is.”</p>
