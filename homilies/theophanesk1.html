<h1>On the Chief-Publican Zacchaeus</h1>
 <h2>By Theophanes Kerameus (12th century)</h2>
 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p class = "intro">Theophanes was born in Sicily; he later became archbishop of Rossano, in Calabria, 
or, possibly, of Tauromenion (modern Taormina), in Sicily.  His dates are usually 
 given as 1129 to 1152, though this is uncertain; he is usually thought to have lived under the reign 
 of King Roger II of Sicily, which lasted from 1130 to 1154.  Nothing else is known of his life, but 
 his writings, a collection of ninety-one Greek homilies, are popular.  The authorship is debated, as 
 his last name simply means "potter," a common surname.  Some differentiate a Bishop of Tauromenion 
 in the 9th century from a Bishop of Rossano in the 12th, with authorshp ascribed to one or the other.  
 Regardless of his identity, his homilies are well-known for their simplicity and oratorical skill.</p>
 <p class ="intro">The homily translated below is on the story of Zacchaeus.  What is interesting, though, 
 is the mention, early in the homily, that "the days of fasting are nigh."  In the Byzantine Rite, preparation 
 for the Great Fast (Lent) begins on the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee; however, the preceding week 
 is the Sunday of Zacchaeus.  It has a set Gospel reading, outside of the normal yearly cycle, but without 
 any Lenten-themed hymns.  It seems that this was true in Theophanes' time as well.  This year's Sunday of 
 Zacchaeus was last Sunday (1/14/2018), meaning that this is an apt reading for today.  I broke the first 
 paragraph into two for ease of reading; the remaining breaks are those found in Migne's edition, though I 
 added the paragraph numbers.</p>
  <h2>Homily 15</h2>
  <h2>On the Chief-Publican Zacchaeus</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first rung of that mystical and divine ladder, which God revealed to the father along the 
way, in sleep, rises the climber a little ways from earth; and the rest, being very light, are led
 to the highest and perfect <i>rung</i>, on which God sustains <i>them</i>.  But the angels ascend and descend, 
 becoming hand-holders for the climbers.  But why, wanting it, do we need the example of the 
 patriarch’s ladder?  The evangelic voice of the readers softly rings in my ears; I conclude that 
 the season of repentance approaches, and the days of fasting, as is custom, are nigh.  
 Therefore, the evangelic ladder sets a first rung for us, repentance, the best entrance into exaltation, 
 through teaching us the history of Zacchaeus, as much as sinners’ understanding is able.  For it does 
 not simply describe a sinful man, but a publican, the greatest of all sinners, is set forth for us.  
 For abominable <i>is</i> money from tax-collecting, and most abhorrent to the all-good God.  For this, when 
 the Savior wants to condemn someone through hyperbole, He uses this name; when <i>He says</i>, “Let him be to
 you as a Gentile, and a publican,” and when <i>He says</i>, “The publicans go before you into the kingdom of 
 God” (Mt 18:17; Mt 21:31).  Elsewhere, reproaching money-lenders hoping to provide a loan, “Do not 
 publicans also do the same?” (Mt 5:46).  For He, saying “publican,” includes in this also the greedy, 
 and the unjust, and the thief, and the silver-lover; and, saying this, that they also worship idols; 
 for Paul calls love-of-silver “idolatry” (cf. Eph 5:5); and the evangelist, naming Zacchaeus not simply
 “publican” but “chief-publican,” shows the extent of <i>his</i> evil.  For, as acquaintance in image with 
 some evil or virtue draws one to the summit, the name of the head is set forth for the business, like 
 “chief-robber,” or “chief-magician,” or “chief-craftsman.”  If, therefore, the publican, now struggling
 in this, and infamously, and thus practicing an unclean way of life, so to also become a teacher
 of evils to others, receives mercy from the Lord through repentance, who does not run, with all haste, 
 to the God-given medicine of repentance?  But, if it seems so, let us repeat the account from the 
 beginning.</li>
 <li>“At that time, Jesus passed through Jericho, and, behold, a man called Zacchaeus by name, 
 and he was the chief-publican, and he was wealthy, and he sought to see the Lord” (Lk 19:1).  The 
 Savior came from Galilee to Jerusalem, able to go by another way, for one easily goes from Samaria to 
 Jerusalem; however, economically, He passed through Jericho.  According to what is clear to all, so 
 that He would heal Bartimaeus of blindness, and draw Zacchaeus the chief-publican to repentance; but, 
 according to the more mystical reason, since He spoke before, in a parable, about Adam, how, descending
 from Jerusalem to Jericho, he was set upon by thieves, and was stripped of <i>his</i> robe, and received 
 wounds, and he needed to the healing of <i>his</i> blow to come from opposites.
<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup> (For healings are the 
 opposites of opposites.)  For this, the Savior went, turning away from Jericho to Jerusalem, leading 
 the wounded man, by Himself, from where he fell; for Jericho is interpreted “descent,” and, namely, 
 the slope into which, slipping, humanity fell.  But let us resume the story’s sequence.  “Jesus,” it 
 says, “passed through.”  But the multitude of the people escorted and accompanied the One drawing <i>them</i> 
 by persuading teaching.  For divine and ineffable grace was running with the Savior’s words, and 
 subduing <i>His</i> hearers’ souls.  And thus it is written, that, “All wondered at the words of grace, going 
 forth from His mouth” (Lk 4:22).  And Zacchaeus, conquered by this, deserted the tax-house; and, since 
 he was little in stature (for this the word also made clear), he ascended a sycamore, thence to glimpse
 the Lord.  O, how much the story shows to lovers-of-learning, to whom the divine words are not read in 
 vain!  Therefore, let us yield to the things taught by the story for contemplation, removing the 
 covering from without, and revealing the hidden philosophy.  Why is Zacchaeus reported to be little in 
 stature?  And why could he, standing on the ground, not even see Jesus?  And why did he climb, not 
 another plant, but a sycamore?  And if the pure know the higher ascent of the soul, they, through
 the far-shining bliss of virtue, are shining with the divine Spirit; but we, stuck in the slime of 
 sins, yield to mediocrity of thoughts.  Zacchaeus was little of stature, truly little, wallowing in 
 little and worthless things, not speaking in the perfection of virtues, lessening <i>his</i> spiritual 
 stature through passions.  How, therefore, was the incomplete soul able to see the all-merciful God 
 in the virtuous way of life?  For this, Zacchaeus, being on earth below, did not see Jesus, being 
 eclipsed by sin, until he rose from the earthly, and became higher through the sycamore.  And you 
 understand, in every way, why the sycamore, that compound plant, through a compound name, acts as a 
 patron for our fall.
<sup><a name='ref.2' href='#ftn.2' class='no_buttons'>[2]</a></sup>
 For, as He knew good and evil, He also revealed sin seeming to be good, 
 through a sinful judgment of the good, and being evil in truth; and, thus, the plant, the sycamore, 
 also seems to be a fig, but it is not a fig in truth.  Therefore, until someone descend from the 
 sycamore, rather, from sin, he cannot see God; and if he is raised above sin, and sees what is better 
 than this, he will see the light-giver, Jesus, the One truly pronouncing salvation to him: “Today 
 salvation <i>has come</i> to your house” (Lk 19:9).</li>
 <li>“Therefore, looking up,” it says, “Jesus saw him, and said: ‘Zacchaeus, hastening, descend; for 
 today I must remain in your house’” (Lk 19:5).  O blessed voice, which Zacchaeus obeyed!  O divine 
 love-for-mankind, speaking to quicken the publican’s faith!  For, at the same time He saw him raised 
 a little above earthly things, He both calls to the lost, and gives courage to the one lacking in 
 boldness; so also He does to the desperate.  At the same time He saw the one shaking off 
 swinish life and running again towards the father’s hearth, He also, running from afar, fell upon 
 <i>him</i>, kissing <i>his</i> neck.  Such <i>is</i> our Master; even if we are marked with myriads of stains, even if 
 our life is filthy, if we show eagerness alone, and let drop the tears of conversion, immediately 
 He will embrace us, He will show <i>His</i> merciful nature, He will forget all the things of the past.  
 But let us return from this digression.  “Zacchaeus, hastening, descend.”  Now, truly, you have become
 Zacchaeus; now, you show energy corresponding to the name.  For Zacchaeus is interpreted <i>conqueror</i>; 
 now, therefore, you have acted as conqueror of passions.  “Zacchaeus, hastening, descend.”  And for 
 what is haste ordained?  So that you learn, that it is not necessary to pursue virtue rashly or 
 unthinkingly, but with eager haste.  Since our life is passing, and it is necessary for us to haste 
 towards the good, while we are surrounded by this fleshly balustrade.  But the saying seems, in some 
 way, opposite to the given aim.  For if Zacchaeus’ ascent into the sycamore is noble (for he was 
 raised above earthly things, and he became above sin), how was he commanded to descend: “Zacchaeus,
 hastening, descend”?  How does He nobly hasten the ascender towards descent?  Historically, the 
 Savior commands <i>him</i> to descend from the tree; anagogically, though, He teaches us, that there is no 
 other fitting beginning of repentance for the sinner than descent.  For this is the blessed humility,
 opposed to demonic puffing.  “Zacchaeus, hastening, descend.”  Do you want to repent?  Lay down the 
 plinth of repentance, and the unshakeable groundwork, humility; descend, so that, arising, you rise 
 on the wings of virtues.  But let us hear what <i>is</i> the chief-publican’s promise, after the Lord’s 
 being received into <i>his</i> home.</li>
 <li>“Behold, the half of my belongings, Lord, I will give to the poor” (Lk 19:8).  So noble <i>is</i> the 
 publican’s plinth of repentance; through good deeds to the wretched, he prepares a well-founded way 
 of salvation for himself; “Behold, the half of my belongings, Lord, I will give to the poor.”  He 
 learned, that, in everyone, as God heals through mercy, He also seeks mercy, not sacrifice.  He was 
 initiated into the mystery by Daniel: “Wipe out your sins in almsgiving, and your lawlessness in 
 compassion for the wretched” (Dan 4:21); for this, he promised to give the half of his belongings to 
 the wretched; and, what he gained from greed, he promised to repay four-fold.</li>
 <li>“For if I have,” he says, “slandered anyone, I will repay four-fold” (Lk 19:8).  He feared the 
 law’s command.  For the divine-sounding Moses legislated this repayment to the thief, and this
 you learn well, holding fast to his sacred laws (cf. Ex 22:1).  Since, therefore, he promised to give 
 the half of <i>his</i> belongings to the poor, it was also very clearly necessary, that, as God does not let 
 the unjust approach, if greedy deeds against the wronged are not first redeemed, he considerately 
 promises to do this.  Therefore, <i>it is</i> highest folly, and least pleasing to the good God, to perform 
 almsgiving from accursed love-of-gain and theft, and to think to serve God by this.  Therefore, 
 let us, being initiated into the mystery, beloved, become imitators of this Zacchaeus; let us not 
 bypass the publican’s repentance; for we are, truly, even we, in Jericho, in the descent of this 
 world, into which we were cast, and the Savior passes by each one, evangelizing through the evangelic 
 teachings.  Let us abandon earthly thought, let us go above the sycamore, rather, sin.  For one <i>cannot</i> 
 otherwise see Christ, unless we rise above the shadow of sin, darkening us.  Let us also give the half
 of <i>our</i> belongings to the poor.  Take the wretched as communers in your excess.  Let much be carried 
 off the ship, so that you sail more lightly, advises Gregory the Theologian.
<sup><a name='ref.3' href='#ftn.3' class='no_buttons'>[3]</a></sup> Likewise, enemies will
 inherit your possessions; why do you not, stealing <i>from them</i> beforehand, give them to God?  Say, 
 then, with Zacchaeus: “Behold, the half of my belongings I will give to the poor.”  But consider 
 your deeds, and how many <i>are</i> foul and wicked, giving to the divine poor every good, and, to each 
 one wronged, repaying four-fold.  Instead of one soul, which, yielding, you have stuffed with fleshly 
 desires, repay the four-element body four-fold, giving to the laboring in repentance, so that, 
 by their intercession, you will also hear the blessed voice: “In your house, I must remain” (Lk 19:5).
 For, truly, the house of the soul of the repentant and the one returning to God, swept clean by a 
 repentant conscience, becomes a house of God.  Therefore, the unfalse God promised to dwell in and 
 walk about us, who have become clean; to Whom belongs all praise and magnificence unto the ages.  Amen.</li>

 This is a very common interpretation of the Parable of the Good Samaritan, starting with the Church 
 Fathers: the man attacked by robbers represents humanity, assaulted and wounded by sin, who is then 
 healed by the mercy of Christ.  (The Greek words for “oil” and “mercy” are very similar, hence the 
 “oil” poured on the man’s wounds in the parable lends itself well to this meaning.)  Jesus could be 
 seen as the Samaritan, the one not of the Jewish race, because He was divine, and, thus, not of the 
 human race, at least before the Incarnation.</p>

The idea here is that the name <i>sycamore</i> comes from two other Greek words: <i>sykēs</i>, meaning “fig” or 
“fig-tree,” and <i>mōros</i>, meaning “stupid” or “foolish.”</p>

Gregory the Theologian is another name for St. Gregory Nazianzen; the closest I have found to this 
quote is in his funeral oration for Basil (<i>Oration</i> 43.60), where he says, “Loving to jettison all 
which he then had, he lightly sailed across life’s sea” (PG 36:576A).  However, I have found an 
unsourced quote attributed to him which is much closer to what Theophanes has: “Ye who desires riches,
 listen to the prophet saying, ‘If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.’  Know that ye are 
 trusting to what is uncertain.  Lighten thy ship somewhat that thou mayest sail the lighter.”  See

 Reading</i>, New Series, Volume 6 (London: Daldy, Isbister, & Co., 1877), 422.</p>
