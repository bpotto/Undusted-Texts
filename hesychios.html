<h1>Encomium on the Holy Andrew</h1>
<h2>By Hesychios of Jerusalem (5th c.)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">Little is known of Hesychios of Jerusalem.  Even the works attributed to him are debated: 
there are many writers with the name of Hesychios, and their works are often mixed.  Hesychios, a priest of Jerusalem,
 is celebrated on March 28 in the East, and he is known for his allegorical and mystical interpretations of the 
 Scriptures, written in very short glosses.  There are also a number of homilies--often short, possibly 
 fragmentary--transmitted under Hesychios' name.  Below is one of those homilies, on the Holy Apostle 
 Andrew the First-Called, listed as <i>Sermon</i> 7 in Migne's edition.<p>
 <h2>Encomium on the Holy Andrew</h2>
 <p>The priestly trumpet called us to the solemnity of Andrew, the first-born of the chorus of the 
 apostles, the first base of the Church’s pillar, Peter before Peter, the foundation before the 
 foundation, the first-fruits of the beginning, the one calling before being called, the one 
 bringing forth before being brought forth.  He preaches a gospel which he has not yet believed; 
 before learning, he reveals life to his brother; he bestows such wealth in the answer to Him, 
 “Where are you staying?”  For the answer has something great, which Andrew, plunging <i>his</i> mind, 
 beheld.  For, “Come,” He says, “and see.”  For how are you become a prophet?  Whence <i>are you</i> 
 suddenly God-bearing?  Why do you assault Peter’s hearing?  Why do you hasten to speak, what you 
 cannot speak?  The One present everywhere, how can you say to have found <i>Him</i>?  But Andrew knew 
 what he said, “We have found what Adam lost, what Eve was fined, what the cloud if sin concealed 
 from our eyes, what transgression separated from us, what David sought: <i>In the day of my 
 affliction I sought God</i> (Ps 76:2).  And, <i>Seek the Lord</i>, Zephaniah cries out, <i>all the humble of 
 the earth</i> (Zeph 2:3).”  God smote us, because He sentenced Adam to death and toilsome life; <i>For 
 He healed, and, striking, bandaged</i> (Hos 6:1); when, being crucified for <i>our</i> race, by His stripe,
 according to Isaiah (cf. Is 53:5), and in the resurrection, He healed all.  Naked Christ was 
 led onto the Cross; for, not having sin, He did not need a garment.  He was blameless and did 
 not need to be hidden.  There was nothing disfigured in Him; for He displayed our disfigurements 
 as well-formed.  The myrrh-bearers found Him, Whom they lost through Eve; she who furnished the 
 reason for loss found the gain.  <i>He came to us, like an early and slow rain on the earth</i> 
 (Hos 6:5).  Therefore, the Lord was, after the Resurrection, revealed early to the women, 
 appearing later to the apostles.  For early to the women <i>He said,</i> “Rejoice”; and later, in Zion, 
 He proclaimed peace to the disciples; to these, so that He would loose the sentence of sorrow; 
 and to those, so that He would destroy the enmity, which the dragon evilly caused.  <i>You will 
 be called Kephas</i> (Jn 1:42); before the confession, the reward; before you work the vineyard, 
 you received the denarius; before you touch the altar, you offered the sacrifice; before you 
 preach, you were crowned.  Christ chose the poor and unlettered; for wisdom does not need 
 lawyers, but officers; for no one supplies her with anything, but we all receive everything 
 from her.<p>
