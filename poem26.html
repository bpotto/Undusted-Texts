<h1>"Poem #26, For the Profession of Isabel de Los Ángeles"</h1>
<h2>By St. Teresa de Ávila (1515-1582)</h2>
<p class = "poems">
Be my joy in lament
in great fear my repose,
my solace in sorrows,
and my wealth from wealth rent.

Amid tempests, my love,
my gift, wounded in strife,
in my death be my life,
despised, favor above.

In poverty, treasures,
in combat, my triumph,
in labor, my quiet,
in sadness, rest secure.

Be my light in light’s loss,
my greatness in place low,
my shortcut on the road,
be my glory the Cross.

My honor’s abasement,
and suffering my palm,
my growth, when wants embalm,
and my gain, effacement.

My fullness in hunger,
and my hope in my fear,
my joys when terror’s near,
my delights when bitter.

In forget, memory,
height in humiliation,
when low, my opinion,
in affront, victory.

Despised, be my laurel,
in pains, my affection,
my worth in dejection,
alone, my wreath floral.

My confidence in Christ,
and my love’s just for Him
in exhaustion, my vim,
and my home in His like.

Here’s founded my firmness
here my security,
test of my verity,
the sign of my fineness.
