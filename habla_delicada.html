<h1>"El habla delicada" / "The delicate speech"</h1>
<h2>By Sor Francisca Josefa del Castillo (1671-1742)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">Sor Francisca Josefa del Castillo was a Poor Clare in what is now Colombia.  
She was born to weathly parents and, at the age of 18, entered the Monastery of St. Clare in
 Tunja, her birthplace.  There she remained for the rest of her life, taking final vows in 1694,
 at the age of 23, and being appointed abbess four times.  At the instigation of her confessors, 
 she recorded her mystical experiences and feelings in poems and in an autobiography.  The following 
 is her most famous poem, #45 in her <i>Afectos espirituales</i> (<i>Spiritual Affections</i>).    
 Another name for the poem is "Deliquios del Divino Amor en el corazón de la criatura, y en las
  agonías del huerto" ("Swoons of Divine Love in the heart of the creature, and in the agonies
   of the garden").</p>
<h2>"El habla delicada"</h2>
<p class = "poems">
	The delicate speech
I esteem from the Lover
milk and honey distills
among roses and lyres.

	His mellifluous word
cuts me quick like the dew
and there flowers with it
the heart withered and drooped.

	How sweetly there enters
His delicate whistle
which makes my heart doubt
if it's the heart itself.

	So well He persuades me
that He melts just like wax--
by same fire enkindled--
the mountains and the crags.

	So strong, so sonorous
is His divine breath,
it wakens the sleeping
and resurrects the dead.

	So sweet and, too, so smooth
it appears to my ear;
it rejoices the bones,
even the most concealed.<p>
