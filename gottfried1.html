<h1>On Sexagesima Sunday</h1>
 <h2>By Gottfried of Admont (d. 1165)</h2>
 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p class = "intro">Gottfried was a Benedictine monk, as was his brother, Irimbert.  In 1130, he became 
abbot of Weingarten Abbey; some years later, he briefly became prior of the Monastery of St. George in the 
Hercynian Forest.  He is most remembered, though, for his time as abbot of Admont Abbey, which he 
became in 1337.  He was known as a reformer, correcting the laxities of monastic life, and as a scholar; 
he is credited with greatly enlarging Admont Abbey's library.  He died on June 25, 1165 and was 
succeeded as abbot by his brother.  He left behind many homilies, in three sets.  The first explains 
the Gospel and Epistle reading for each Sunday; the second explains them for the Feasts of the year; 
the third explains various Scripture passages.  This homily is from the first group; it is on the 
readings for Sexagesima Sunday, the second Sunday before Lent.  The readings are 2 Cor 11:19-13, 
12:1-9 and Lk 8:4-15.  Paragraph divisions are from Migne's text, but I have added the numbers.</p>
  <h2>Homily XXIII</h2>
  <h2>On Sexagesima Sunday</h2>
  <h3><i>When a great crowd gathered, and came to Him from the cities, He said, through similitude: He 
  who sows went out to sow his seed</i> (Lk 8:4-5).</h3>
  <ol>
<li>This man, <i>who went out to sow his seed</i>, signifies He Who says this, Our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Who is well compared to sowing man.  For He it is Who sowed all that is.  He it is Who formed and 
created all existence.  But why does He say: <i>He went out</i>?  Where did He go, or whence did 
<i>He go out</i>?  
In some way, He was within, since the invisible God remained unknown to man, in the substance of His 
invisible divinity.  Truly, <i>He went out</i>, when, descending from the bosom of the Father into the womb of 
the Virgin mother, He assumed humanity’s form, through which the invisible God appeared a visible man, 
to the world.  But He was also within in another way, when, in that assumed form of humanity, He hid 
Himself for thirty years, since He manifested His omnipotence to the world by no sign nor doctrine of 
divinity.  But <i>He went out to sow His seed</i>, when He began to preach to the world with flashing miracles.
  Indeed, <i>He went out</i> daily <i>to sow His seed</i> in His preaching, in teachings of truth, while His mercies 
  preceded the words of teaching in the hearts of listeners.  For everyone who preaches labors in 
  frustration, unless the omnipotent God, in His blessings, precedes and opens the heart of man.  For 
  He is the key of David, which opens and no one closes, closes, and no one opens (cf. Rev 3:7).</li>
<li>And while He sows, some fell by the way, and <i>it was trampled, and the birds of heaven ate it</i> (Lk 8:5).  
These words which, as Blessed Gregory says, Truth explains by Himself, do not presume to discuss human 
weakness.
<sup><a name='ref.1' href='#ftn.1' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>
  But yet it is necessary for us, if someone can make His exposition of them plainer for us.  
For they, His elected disciples, the holy apostles who were wise, who, as much as is possible, 
communicated at the living font of eternal Wisdom and knowledge, day and night, comprehended and 
understood much from little; this little sufficed; but we, miserable ones, who are of tardy heart, 
and sometimes comprehend and understand very little from many words, I do not say the parable, but 
the parable’s exposition is too obscure for us.</li>
<li>But if we are imitators of the apostolic life, we can hope the word, which He replied to them, 
seeking the mystery of this parable, is, nevertheless, spoken to us.  <i>To you</i>, He says, <i>it is given to 
know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but, to the rest, in parables</i> (Lk 8:9).  These words were then 
spoken to them corporally; the same words are daily spoken spiritually us spirits, that is, men.  By 
<i>the mystery of the kingdom of God</i>, the mystery of Sacred Scripture is understood, which is not 
incongruously compared to the kingdom of God, when God is truly in Holy Scripture, God is truly known 
from Holy Scripture. Holy Scripture, which speaks to spirits of the mysteries of the kingdom of God, 
is like a <i>parable</i> to worldly men.</li>
<li>And what He says is to be noted: <i>To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God</i>.  
For He affirms that to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, to know the mystery of Sacred Scripture, 
is given to us, not so that we know, but so that, by what we know, we will strive to fulfill by works.  
For to know the Scriptures profits us nothing, if good action does not follow good knowledge.  Indeed, 
it hurts more than it profits, as the Lord testifies, Who says: <i>The servant knowing the will of his 
master, and not doing it, will be greatly flogged</i> (Lk 12:47); and the apostle: <i>The one knowing the good 
and not doing it, he is sinful</i> (Jas 4:17).</li>
<li>But since He subjoins: <i>That the seers not see, and the hearers not understand</i>, we think that, 
through this, the learned and the unlearned cannot be treated unequally.  For those knowing the 
Scripture’s mysteries are rightly called <i>seers</i>: those not knowing, but awaiting the word of God from 
others, are rightly denoted by <i>hearers</i>.  <i>The seers do not see</i>, who, reading the Scriptures, see 
something by knowledge, but do not see it by experience.  <i>The hearers do not understand</i>, who hear by 
doctrine, but do not know by efficacy.  By what was briefly touched on before, we see what are the 
three things which the eternal Wisdom of God proposes to us in this reading.  First, He posits <i>the way</i>, 
after the way, <i>the stone</i>, after the stone, <i>the thorns</i>.</li>
<li><i>And when he sows, it says, some fell by the way, and was trampled, and the birds of heaven ate it.  
And some fell upon the stone, and, being born, fell to run, since it had no moisture.  And some fell 
among thorns, and the thorns, arising together, suffocated it</i> (Lk 8:5-7).</li>
<li>By <i>the way</i>, we can understand the mind’s negligence, by <i>the stone</i>, the heart’s hardness, by <i>the 
thorns</i>, the heart’s avarice.  These are the three, by which the seed of the Word of God, sown in the 
field of our hearts, perishes, since, at dawning, it will not be able to produce fruit through good 
action.  <i>By the way</i> the seed falls, when the word of God is preached to the negligent.  Therefore, 
the Lord says: <i>But that which is by the way, are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes the 
word from their heart, lest, believing, they be saved</i> (Lk 8:12).  <i>By the way</i> are those who are not 
solicitous about their own custody.  <i>With all custody</i>, says Solomon, <i>preserve your heart, since life 
proceeds from it</i> (Prv 4:23).  What is sown by the way is trampled, since where the guard is removed, 
namely, the mind’s solicitous vigilance, noxious, useless, and vain thoughts, in turn, succeed it, 
licitly retire, and advance; the heart of man is like a triple way, in which, even if the seed of the 
word of God falls, it cannot germinate there, but <i>the birds of heaven ate it</i>, since unclean spirits, 
designated by <i>birds</i>, entering and exiting through suggestions and unclean thoughts, even if something 
good arises in that heart, seize, devastate, and devour it.</li>
<li>After the way, He rightly posits <i>the stone</i>, by which we understand the heart’s hardness: since, while the torpid 
and negligent mind is bound by no custody, justly is it thus hardened and blinded in itself by God’s 
judgment, since, even when it willed, it could not return to its interior, either through the remembrance
 of sins, or for the desire of eternal things.  Whence the Lord, after He says: <i>And some fell upon the 
 stone</i>, rightly adds: <i>And, being born, it fell to ruin, since it had no moisture</i>.  This moisture is the 
 moisture of tears, by which the conceived seed of the Word of God is assiduously irrigated.  For 
 the Word of God is conceived when it is heard; it is born when it leads to the effect of good action.  
 But if the moisture of tears is lacking, <i>being born, it will fall to ruin</i>, since, whatever good will 
 or good action man gives birth to from hearing the word of God, from the aridity of a hard heart, as 
 if born, it falls to ruin, it does not grow, it does not advance into the fruit of perfect action.  
 Therefore the Lord says:</li>
 <li><i>For those upon the stone, they are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and they
 do not have roots, since for a time they believe, and, in the time of temptation, recede</i> (Lk 8:13).  
 There are some who <i>receive the word of God with joy</i>, namely, who listen freely, who propose to follow 
 what they heard.  But since they are <i>stone, and do not have roots</i>, since they lack the virtues of 
 humility and perseverance, which are <i>roots</i>, they begin, in some way, to fulfill and follow what was 
 heard with deeds, but when temptation assaults, if wrath or envy seizes the mind, if prosperity, if
 adversity show themselves to someone, they leave what was well begun, they run back to pristine custom
 of the vices of instability and inconstancy, since it <i>for a time believes, and in the time of 
 temptation, recedes</i>.  And since such is the heart of man, that nothing avails to be there except what 
 it loves, while it neglects God and those things which are God’s, and condemns <i>them</i>, it begins to love 
 the world and the things which are the world’s, it strains to be overtaken.  Whence, after the way, 
 after the stone, He rightly places <i>the thorns</i>.</li>
 <li><i>And some</i>, He says, <i>fell among thorns, and the thorns, arising together, suffocated it</i> (Lk 8:7).  
 By <i>thorns</i>, we said that avarice is to be understood.  But it is not avarice of money alone, but of 
 honor and of lust, as the same Author of Truth proves, saying: <i>But what fell among thorns, they are 
 those who hear, and are suffocated by solicitudes and riches and the lusts of life, and do not bear 
 fruit</i> (Lk 8:14).  What are solicitudes, riches, and lusts of life except avarice!  These are those 
 three tyrants who fight us, who always recall and retard us from doing and producing the fruit of 
 justice and truth, namely, the devil, the world, and the flesh, which we bear.  The devil fights us 
 through solicitudes, when he does not solicit and perturb through his suggestions.  The world fights 
 us through riches, namely, the favors and honors of the present life.  Our flesh fights us through 
 lusts, so that, resisting the spirit, we love the deeds of the flesh.  These are the evilly-fighting 
 thorns, which, if they fix a root in the heart of man, even if the seed of the word of God is sown 
 there and rises, <i>the thorns, arising together, suffocate</i> it, so that <i>it does not bear fruit</i>, as it is 
 not able to rise to the study of good action.</li>
 <li>Against these three, <i>the way</i>, <i>the stone</i>, and <i>the thorns</i>, the Psalmist prayed, saying: <i>Incline my 
 heart to Your testimonies, and not to avarice</i> (Ps 118:36).  Against <i>the way</i>, he places this word, 
 <i>incline</i>, by which humility is designated, since the heart founded in humility closes off the entrance 
 malign spirits from itself, by the virtue of humility, lest it be unpassable or passable to their 
 suggestions and prompts.  Against the way, against the mind’s negligence, he prayed, saying <i>incline 
 my heart</i>.  Against <i>the stone</i>, against the heart’s hardness, he prayed, adding <i>to Your testimonies</i>, by 
 which is expressed meditation on the Sacred Scripture, since there is nothing which so softens the 
 heart of man as meditation on the testimonies of God, from which is generated the solicitous 
 observation of the commands of God.  After these two, namely, <i>the way</i> and <i>the stone</i>, man will turn 
 away, through humility and the observation of the commands of God; the third, which is avarice, will 
 not prevail against him.  For a humble heart, and one solicitous in the observation of the commands 
 of God, even if it is fought by the devil, by solicitudes, by the world, by riches and honors, by the
 flesh, by lusts, yet it is not overcome, but, the seed of the word of God growing within him, he is 
 daily animated to bear fruit worthy of God.  Therefore, the Lord subjoined, and said:</li>
 <li><i>And some fell on good earth, and, rising, bore fruit a hundredfold</i> (Lk 8:8).  What He signified by 
 <i>good earth</i> and <i>fruit a hundredfold</i>, He Himself explains, when He says: <i>But that on good earth, these 
 are they who, hearing, retain the word of God in a good and best heart, and bear fruit in patience</i> 
 (Lk 8:15).  The <i>good earth</i> designates the good man, <i>good heart</i> figuratively designates a fearful heart,
 <i>best heart</i>, a loving heart.  And rightly do these two, namely, fear and love, oppose the two preceding,
 namely, the way and the stone, fear against the way, love against the stone.  For the fear of God
 constrains man, lest he be on the way, lest he be negligent in the heart’s custody; the love of God
 softens man, lest he be stone, namely, stony earth, the internal humor of sweetness being dried up.  
 Therefore, we can say <i>the good heart</i> to be the heart watched by custody, <i>the best heart</i>, the heart 
 softened by love’s grace.</li>
 <li>And well does He say: <i>They who, hearing, retain the word in a good and best heart</i>.  The word of God
 <i>is heard by a good heart, is retained by a best heart</i>.  For it is good to hear the word of God, it is 
 best to retain <i>it</i>, that is, to fulfill <i>it</i> by works.  From these two, from a good and best heart, from 
 divine fear and love, that <i>fruit</i> is born, by which God is delighted and fed.  That fruit is the fruit 
 of the love of God and neighbor, which, therefore, is designated by <i>fruit a hundredfold</i>, since, when 
 God is loved above all, when, for God, love of neighbor is guarded among all, the reward of eternal 
 beatitude is multiplied a hundredfold.  But since neither love of God nor love of neighbor can be 
 administered without the adversities and perturbations of the present life, the Lord subjoins here, 
 and says:</li>
 <li><i>And bears fruit in patience</i>.  The Lord warns us, in these few words, that we not, moved by 
 prosperities or adversities, be idle in love of God, not fall from the love of God through any 
 interruptions by various things or by occasional perturbations, but that we always bear our <i>fruit in 
 patience</i>.  Did not the vase of election, Paul, I say, the apostle, bear this fruit, the fruit of love
 of God and neighbor, in patience, who, for love of God, by which he was inflamed, so burn with love of
 neighbor, [158] that he could not be recalled from his intention, by which he labored for the salvation
 of neighbors, by any adversities or labors of the present life?  For what he underwent, how he labored 
 more than all of Christ’s disciples, he himself enumerates in today’s reading, in which he says: <i>From 
 the Jews I received, five times, forty minus one</i> lashes.  <i>Thrice I was felled by rods, once I was 
 stoned, thrice I was shipwrecked.  Night and day I was in the depth of the sea, often, in my journeys,
 amid perils of currents, perils of thieves, perils from</i> my <i>race, perils from the nations, perils in 
 the city, perils in solitude, perils in the sea, perils amid false brethren, in labor and hardship, in
 many vigils, in cold and nudity</i> (2 Cor 11:24-27).  Let us also, beloved brethren, who ought to be 
 imitators of the apostolic life, imitate such a man, let us strive, lest we be <i>the way</i>, lest we be <i>the 
 stone</i>, lest we be <i>thorns</i> suffocating the seed of the word of God in us, lest we be those to whom the 
 Lord speaks <i>in parables</i>, but <i>rather</i> those to whom He opens the mystery of His kingdom, in which we are
 taught, so that we be good earth, which, in a good and best heart, hears and retains the word of God, 
 and bears fruit in patience, which remains without end.  May He Himself deign to help, Who, with the 
 Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns through all the ages of ages.  Amen.</li>
