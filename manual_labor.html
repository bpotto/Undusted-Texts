<h1>Manual Labor of the Soul</h1>
<h2>By Hugo of Fouilloy (c. 1096-1172)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class = "intro">Born at Fouilloy, Hugo received an education from Benedictines before 
becoming a religious himself--probably Benedictine.  He began at the priory of St.-Laurent-au-Bois 
while still young, later becoming founding prior of St.-Nicholas-de-Regny in 1332 and 
eventually returning to St.-Laurent as prior in 1152.  There he died, and little else is known of his life.</p>
<p class='intro'>Though biographical information is sparse, we have a number of his writings.  Though 
often overshadowed--or absorbed--by his co-named contemporary, Hugo of St. Victor (1096-1141), 
some still read his works.  Like Hugo of St. Victor and his student Richard of St. Victor (d. 1173), 
Hugo of Fouilloy wrote mystical theology, particularly focusing on mystical allegories.  His most 
well-known work is <i>De avibus</i> (<i>On Birds</i>) which is both a bestiary and a collection of 
moral and mystical treatises about each bird.  Along with the <i>De medicina animae</i> (<i>Of the 
Medicine of the Soul</i>), he is also known for <i>De claustro animae</i> (<i>Of the Cloister of 
the Soul</i>), from which the following selection is taken.  The work describes the soul using the 
allegory of a monastery and its various parts.  This selection--Book III, Ch. VII--is on the soul's 
allegory to manual labor (the <i>labora</i> of the Benedictine <i>ora et labora</i>).  It immediately 
follows the chapter on the monastic practice of "chapter," when monks gather to hear readings of 
saints' lives and a sermon from their superior, receive their tasks for the day, and correct 
their faults.  Since the word for "soul" in the main ancient Christian languages--Latin and Greek--
is feminine, I have referred to the soul as "she" throughout this translation, in keeping with common 
practice for this style of text.</p>
<h2>Manual Labor of the Soul</h2>
<p>After the chapter, the brethren are wont to depart for manual labor: so, after the quiet of 
contemplation, the soul departs to the labor providing for bodily need.  She departs from 
contemplation, who enjoyed celestial delectation.  She departs, and descends, where, and how?  
She departs from celestial contemplation to meditation on the Scriptures, and, making a stay 
there, she hears the present life’s misery, the future’s beatitude, indeed, she considers the 
prize of the just, and she awaits the punishment of the damned.  Then, drawn by the love of 
prizes and touched by the fear of punishments, she descends to the memory of his own 
offenses.  Who, then, knows his own fault, more quickly ignores another’s, and, therefore, after 
the memory of offenses, she descends to compassion for neighbors, then, truly, she progresses 
to perform their care.  And this can be demonstrated, in similitude, when someone departs from 
the bridal chamber into the house, from the house into the porch, from the porch into the 
village, from the village into the field.  She departs, indeed, from celestial contemplation 
to the meditation on the Scriptures, as if from the bridal chamber into the house; from the 
meditation of the Scriptures to the memory of offenses, as if from the house into the porch; 
from the memory of offenses to the compassion for neighbors, as if from the porch into the 
village; from the compassion for neighbors to performing their care, as if from the village 
into the field.  In contemplation, therefore, there is quiet, in the rest, labor.  
In the meditation of the Scriptures we labor, fearing lest we lose the prizes of the just; 
in the memory of offenses, laboring, we weep, lest we be with the damned.  In compassion for 
neighbors, indeed, is the labor of work.  In the first we are warned, in the second we are 
taught, in the third we are moved, in the fourth we are rewarded.  The Scripture warns what 
we ought to do; it teaches the memory of offense, so that we be penitent; we are moved by 
compassion, so that we love; we truly merit a good work, so that that with which we succor 
others would succor us.</p>
<p>Then the soul departs into the garden, so that she would see the gardener, namely, Christ, 
Who plants the grass of virtues.  And she departs to moisten the herbs, that is, to deplore 
the fragility of the flesh with tears.  But, as the sun shines clearer after a rain: so Christ, 
after the irrigation of tears, appears more benign, extending the rays of His knowledge 
and illuminating the heart with the word of consolation.  Mary Magdalene departed to the sepulcher
 as if into the garden, so that she would plant and irrigate; she found Him Who gives increase, 
 and she heard: <i>Woman, what do you cry?  Whom do you seek?</i> (Jn 20:15).  Behold, after the rain of 
 compunction, the clarity of consolation irradiates.  And she, having heard what He sought, 
 thinking that He was the gardener, said: <i>Lord, if you took Him away, tell me where you placed 
 Him, and I will take Him</i> (Jn 20:15).  Mary despaired of the fruit of labor, since she doubted 
 the truth of the resurrection.  Whence it is said that she turned around (cf. Jn 20:14).  She 
 turned back, who fell down in the Lord’s face through doubt.  Mary planted through love, but of 
 the fruit of the resurrection she doubted, because of the resurrection’s delay.  But 
 when she knew Christ, she gathered fruit.  For what does the seed of corruption profit, what 
 the flower of nativity, what the maturity of passion, except that the fruit of the hope of the 
 resurrection follows?</p>
 <p>The soul departs again, so that she would dig around <i>the fig-tree</i>, so that what was sterile 
 would bear fruit (cf. Lk 13:6-9), so that she would send forth a basket of dung, that is, so 
 that she would return the festering memory of sin.  And she enters into the vineyard, so that 
 she would dig around it, so that she would prune the twigs, that is, the growths of superfluity, 
 so that what is luxurious in palms, would redound in fruits.  Whence in the Canticle of Canticles: 
 <i>Come, my beloved, let us depart into the field, let us linger in the villas, let us raise a hand 
 to the vines; let us see, indeed, if the vine flourishes, if the flowers bring forth fruit</i> (Sgs 
 7:11-12).  <i>Let us depart</i>, he says, <i>into the field</i>.  The soul departs from contemplation 
 to circumspection of herself, she departs from care of herself to performing the care of the 
 neighbor, so that she would console the pusillanimous, correct the restless, so that she would 
 make into a field of virtues what was before brambles and thorns.   <i>Let us linger</i>, he says, <i>in 
 the villas</i>, that is, among those who are villains, that is, rude and tardy in perceiving the 
 evidence of the curia of Christ.  For some are cloistered or curial, but some are villains, that 
 is, unordained, who do not seek the edification of the mind, but the filling of the belly: they 
 are amazed at earthly things, they know earthly things.  Among these it is necessary that we 
 make a stay, for doctrine, for discipline.  <i>Let us raise a hand to the vines.</i>  For they who want 
 to prune the twigs of the vines, that is, the superfluities of souls, ought to raise a 
 hand, that is, not in laziness, but they <i>ought</i> to precede in example and work.  <i>Let us see if 
 the vine flourishes, if the flowers bring forth fruit</i>, that is, let us make <i>ourselves</i> see, if 
 the soul flourishes in good thoughts, if she produces the fruit of good works.</p>
 <p>What?  Is she not to be quieted among works?  Therefore, the soul says: <i>As an apple among 
 the trees of the forests, so is my beloved among sons.  Under the shadow of him whom I desired, 
 I sat</i> (Sgs 2:3).  Three things are to be considered in the apple, namely, a free shadow, a good 
 fruit, a sweet smell.  For Christ gives the shadow of precepts, which defends us from the heat 
 of vices, <i>so that the sun not burn by day, nor the moon by night</i> (Ps 121:6).  It has fruit among 
 the leaves, that is, good work among words.  For it is written of it: it does what it teaches 
 (cf. Acts 21:23).  And the smell of this fruit is sweet, that is, the fame of good work. 
 Therefore, under the shadow, which she desires, the soul sits, who wants to be quiet.  But 
 sometimes she sits upon hay, sometimes upon a stool, sometimes upon a bench, sometimes upon a
 chair.  Upon hay she sits, when she subjects the flesh; upon a stool, when she subjects the 
 world.  Whence the blessed Jerome: “Great,” he says, “is the exultation of the soul, to have 
 the world under <i>her</i> feet."<sup><a name='ref.001' href='#ftn.001' class='no_buttons'>[1]</a></sup>  And when she sits upon a bench, she chooses a new place, so to 
 hear: <i>Friend, ascend higher</i> (Lk 14:10), that she not, with blushing, descend and hear: <i>Give 
 this one a place</i> (Lk 14:9).  Who follows humility, is called above; but who chooses pride, 
 descends below.  They sit upon the chair, not of justice, but of pestilence, of whom it is said:
 <i>What they say, do, but what they do, do not do</i> (Mt 23:3).</p>
 <p>After the quiet of rest, the soul arises again to labor, so that she would gather grapes 
 from the vineyards of Engeddi (Sgs 1:14), not from the vineyard of the Sodomites; from the 
 vineyard of Soreq, not from the suburbs of Gomorra: so that she would wear bundles of myrrh 
 between her breasts, so that she would receive grain-ears in the field of Boaz, which escaped 
 the hands of the reapers (cf. Ruth 2:2).  From the vineyards of Engeddi, and from the vineyards 
 of Soreq, the soul gathers grapes, when the fruit requires penitence or the prizes of choice.  
 Engeddi is interpreted <i>the font of the kid</i>; Soreq, <i>elect</i>.  The kids which descend into this font 
 ascend as new lambs.  For in the font of compunction the filths of the flesh are washed away, 
 the odor of the kid is washed away, that is, the lust for sin, the petulance of a kid, that is, 
 carnal luxury.  From the vineyards of Engeddi, <i>there is</i> good wine, from the vineyards of 
 Soreq, the best wine; with that one the beloved is inebriated, with this one the most beloved.  
 That <i>is</i> mixed water, this is pure.  That one is disturbed by natural lees, that is, carnal lusts;
 but this one is not disturbed by any temporal tribulation.  That one retains the old taste of 
 the vase, that is, the memory of sin; this one is redolent of cleanness, that is, the sweetness 
 of the purified heart.  Therefore, the wine from the vineyards of Engeddi, and from the vineyard 
 of Soreq, is made of pigment and honey, the wine from the vineyard of the Sodomites, and from the
 suburbs of Gomorra, of venom and gall.  <i>For the gall of dragons is their wine, and the unhealthy 
 venom of asps</i> (Dt 32:33).  Gomorra is interpreted, <i>dryness</i>; Sodom, <i>sterility</i>.  For those who are
 remote from the font of compunction, who are not moistened by the rain of preaching, who are not 
 suffused with the sprinkling of celestial dew, that is, the subtlety of contemplation, 
 what wonder if they be dry or sterile?</p>
 <p>For moisture generates fecundity, dryness, sterility; but she bears bundles of myrrh between 
 her breasts, who, compassionate in heart and expending manual labor, provides for the necessities
 of <i>her</i> neighbors.  She bears bundles of myrrh, who puts to sleep the flesh’s lust through 
 affliction, namely, fasting, vigil, labor.  She bears bundles of myrrh between her breasts, 
 who,  suffering together, keeps the stoning of Stephan, the fire of Laurence, the cross of Peter,
 the death of Christ in heart (that is, between the breasts).  Whence in the Canticle: <i>Like a 
 bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he will dwell between my breasts</i> (Sgs 1:12).  Between the 
 breasts of the spouse, like a bundle of myrrh, the beloved dwells, when, in someone’s 
 heart, Christ’s passion is renewed with bitterness, through memory.  Truly <i>in the field of Boaz, 
 the grain-ears which evaded the reapers’ hands, she gathers</i> (Ruth 2:2), who diligently seeks 
 intact sentences from great doctors.  Like Ruth the Moabitess, the soul, namely, the sinner, 
 following her daughter-in-law, comes to Judea, the land of confession.  There, in the field of 
 Boaz, following behind the backs of the reapers, that she not err from doctrine, their grain-ears,
 that is, sentences, she gathers, which the law commands to remain as the food of widows, orphans,
 and strangers.  Then, beating her harvest with a stick, that is, subtle discretion, she finds 
 three measures, which are the triple intellect<sup><a name='ref.002' href='#ftn.002' class='no_buttons'>
 [2]</a></sup> according to the measure of the donation of Christ.
 From these, therefore, we are sustained in the time of famine, so that our soul may live.</p>

 St. Jerome, <i>Against Jovinian</i> II.11 (PL 23:301A): “Great is exultation of the soul, when it is 
 content with little, to have the world under its feet, and to change all its power, dishes, and 
 pleasures, for which riches are sold, into vile foods, and to compensate with a ruder tunic.”</p>

 I am uncertain which “triple intellect” Hugo is referring to here.  There are multiple different 
 schemes of a tripartite intellect; a possible one Hugo may be using is divine intellect, 
 sensual intellect, and rational intellect, though this is only a guess.</p>
