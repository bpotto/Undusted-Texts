<h1>Oration on the All-Honorable and Divine Birth of Our All-Innocent Lady,
 the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary</h1>
 <h2>By Neophytos the Recluse (1134-1214)</h2>
<ol>
<li>The beginning of every fruit [is] the flower, and most manifest [is] this; 
and the beginning of our salvation [is] the God-given and God-chosen birth of 
the innocent and all-immaculate Mary the ever-virgin; and this [is] most clear.  
And, celebrating it, today we worthily feast.  For that all the circle of the 
year be blessed through her, she was born in the present month, the first of the 
year, she fell asleep in the final sleep of immortality, that, the ten months 
between them receiving the image of a circle, she would bless [them] through her 
birth and the life-giving dormition; about which [dormition] it is not the time to 
speak suitably, but when the time of her holy dormition will come.  But now we have 
come forth to philosophize briefly about her holy birth, and we have so much to speak 
about it, as her grace, extended, breathes the word into us.</li>
<li>For the parents of this divine child [were] Joachim and Anna, from the family of 
King David, from the tribe of Juda, guardians of the law and exact keepers of the divine 
commandments, greatly rich in goods, and richer in divine virtue, but poor in childlessness 
through the bonds of sterility of the blessed Anna.  Whence she also received much reproach 
from the sons of Israel, from the priests receiving twice the offered gifts to God [from her]; 
but [they] also fearlessly reproached [her] through not having seed in Israel.  And thence 
the just Joachim, having grieved exceedingly, and having separated from all human company, 
retired to the desert, in which, fasting forty days, in weeping and fasting he entreated the 
Lord, and, “Remove from me,” he said, “Lord, remove from me the reproach and contempt of 
childlessness; and be pleased, Lord, to give orderly seed, and I, again, will return it, Master, 
to Your goodness.”<br />
Therefore, the just one, thusly begging the divine favor, received the thing desired: 
for the just cried out, it says, and the Lord heard them (Ps 107:6).  And thence the all-merciful 
Lord quickly heard him, that, through his seed, He would fulfill the fore-seen mystery hidden 
before the ages.  Therefore also the angel of God, standing before Joachim, says to him that 
“the Lord heard your request, and Anna, your wife, will conceive, and in all the universe your 
seed will be spoken of.”</li>
<li>But the just Anna in her garden struck up a double lamentation about her husband’s 
retirement and her fruitlessness; that “I have not been likened to the birds of heaven,” 
she said, “for these [are] not fruitless before God; I have not been likened to either to 
the beasts, or to the fish, so to bring forth the fruit of the womb to God.  But if even to me, 
Lord, You order fruit of the womb to be given, this I will return again to You, Lord, my God.”<br />
But, her saying these things to God in weeping, also she similarly received from the divine angel 
the gospels of childbearing, and the arrival of [her] husband from the desert; she sacrificed a 
multitude of animals, not a few, and made a great feast for all the people.  And Anna, being 
loosed from the bonds of sterility by the creator of nature, conceived with her husband Mary 
the divine child, to whom also she gave birth today, the first-fruits of our salvation, and 
the pure mother of the Word God, and the first-fruits of the renewal of our nature, grown old 
through the transgression of the divine commandment and obscured.  And according to the divine 
saying, as the whole lump of three measures of wheat is leavened through a little leaven, thusly 
also there, through this God-formed and hyper-pure leaven, the former, reforming, renewed our 
grown-old lump.  And this is the paradoxical wonder, the one overfull of stupor, that the 
hyper-pure bread-maker  ineffably mixed Himself with this most pure leaven, and, taking 
something from her part, wondrously worked all our lump and all the form.  Therefore also 
He said after these things: I am the living bread, and I am the bread of life; who eats Me 
will not hunger (cf. Jn 6:51, 54, 35), and the rest.</li>
<li>The God-wise parents of the all-innocent divine child, fulfilling the promise, 
brought her forth, after three years, to God, into the holies of holies with the virginal 
choir and the shining lamps, and [then] was fulfilled the virgins will be carried up after 
her to the King God, and they will be led into the temple of the king (cf. Ps 45:14-15), 
which is Solomon’s; and the hear, daughter, and see, and forget your people and the 
house of your father; and the king of glory, Christ, will desire your beauty (cf. Ps 45:10-11), 
which also occurred.  And she forgot the people and the house of her father, spending her time 
in the house of the Lord and in the holies of holies.  For into those [places] which the 
high priest entered once a year, a maiden virgin spent each day, that the Scripture would be 
fulfilled.<br />
But we do not have need to speak suitably about the entrance of the virgin into the holies 
of holies before the appointed time; but when the time of that feast comes, then will we 
speak again, if God and the divine child Mariam extend something.  But now there is something 
brief to relate about her God-given birth, and, as the new and pure queen is hailed with 
suitable things, and the word is ceased, that we not prefer to philosophize much about these, 
but rather [speak words] easily seen and easily grasped and in prose, that also the whole 
argument be easily related, and the hearers be sober, not weighted with rash sleep, but that 
they have sober and sleepless hearing.</li>
<li>Therefore, rejoice, God-crowned queen of the world, virgin maiden all-immaculate, chosen 
by God before all generations to be the dwelling of the Word, God-graced, and, in the last 
times, born today from unfruitful sides,  you showed the fruit-bearing of immortal life, 
and the cosmic reconciliation of God through your birth.  Rejoice, lady, and the power of 
queens below, since, about to be revealed as mother of the God of the angels, you have, from 
the divine angel, the ministering of all that which is under you; therefore, both your 
begetting father and the mother conceiving you received the gospels about you from the holy 
angel.  And, having [your] dwelling in the holies of holies, you received food from the 
divine angel, as truly befitting [you].  Rejoice, pure virgin, the bar of virginity,
 the fame of virgins, the wall of the Church of God, the beginning and the end of our salvation, 
 and the divine heirloom altogether more precious than all gold.  Rejoice, Theotokos virgin, 
 the bride of the Father, the mother of the Son, and the ornamented house of the 
 Holy Spirit.  Rejoice, all-innocent, pure, virgin Theotokos, the ensouled house of 
 the uncontainable Trinity, the holy dove, the most pure turtle-dove, the swallow 
 pre-indicating the saving spring, the handsome, the sweet-speaking nightingale, 
 the one singing for us the salvific prayers and, generally, the universal cause of goods.<br />
 Rejoice, Theotokos virgin, the ensouled city, the divine palace of the king of glory, 
 His mighty and uplifted throne, the couch and the table of the king of the heavens.  
 Rejoice, virgin pure, the undefeated wall, the averter of enemies, the refuge of the 
 faithful and the joy of those confiding in you, all-hymned one.  Rejoice, Theotokos virgin, 
 the container of the uncontained, the joy of the earthborn, the delight of the angels, 
 the hope of men, the heavenly door of the faithful, the ensouled, ornamented heaven of the 
 dwelling of God.  Rejoice, pure virgin-mother, the inner room of the kingdom above, the 
 divine treasure-house of those above and those below.  Rejoice, Theotokos virgin, the cause 
 of our delight, the once receiving the “rejoice” through the angel and conceiving and 
 giving birth to one of the Trinity, and, as the cause of unceasing joy, the one wholly 
 destroying the sorrow of the foremother.<br />
 But now having received this, the final “rejoice,” all-immaculate maiden, hasten to 
 prayer for us all, those celebrating your honorable birth, God-graced one, that we find 
 the fruition of eternal goods, through the grace and love for mankind of the thrice-holy God, 
 to Whom [be] the glory and the power, always, now and ever and unto the ages of ages.  Amen.</li>
