<h1>The Martyrdom of the Holy Abramios (c. 343)</h1>
<h4>Feast Day: February 4</h4>
<h2>From the Acts of the Persian Martyrs under Shapur II</h2>
<ol>
	<li>In the fifth year of the persecution against us, the most holy bishop Abramios 
	of the city of Arbēl was held back according to the command of the archmage Aderphora, 
	of the homeland of Iab.  That archmage, forcing him, the holy Abramios, to venerate the sun, 
	and he not willing to do this, all his body by fearful tortures was destroyed, him, 
	the holy one, crying out in those unendurable sufferings and saying that, 
	“A Christian am I, and one God the true I venerate, and Him alone I worship, 
	and in His holy and true faith until death I persevere; 
	and do not force me to venerate creatures and handiworks."</li>
	<li>And he, the holy one, crying out these things in the tortures, 
	the impious one said to him, “Do the will of the king, and live.”  
	But the martyr of Christ Abramios, answering, said to him, 
	“And you and your wretched prince I set at naught, and your king, 
	and he, as being a transgressor, I despise, and I mock his gods.  
	But as much as the king wished by his bragging to trample underfoot 
	our humility and to defeat our truth by his impiety, behold! many more will see 
	our humble figure and magnify abundantly the things according to us toward God, 
	and but he will be humbled and despise by the things with him; 
	and our fulfilled truth will be glorified, but the mocked one will be dishonored; 
	and each day under our feet we will trample him.”  
	And the tyrant, hearing the insolences [toward] the king, 
	the ones spoken by the holy one, commanded him immediately to be beheaded; 
	and forthwith the blessed Abramios was taken up into an unwalled village named Thelam.  
	And [he] was competed in the month of February, on the fifth, in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
	to Whom the glory and the power now and ever and unto the ages of ages.  Amen.</li>
