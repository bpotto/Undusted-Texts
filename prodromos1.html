<h1>Stanzas on Creation<h1>
<h2>By Theodore Prodromos (c. 1100 - c. 1165)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="intro">Almost nothing is known about the life of Theodore Prodromos, except that he was
in contact with the circles of the Byzantine court during most of his life, and he died as a monk.  
His writings often portray him as the so-called "Ptochoprodromos" (Poor Prodromos), so he was probably not rich.
Though his biography is almost non-existent, he left a plethora of writings.  Prodromos was a 
prolific poet, on both sacred and secular topics, including a number of satires.  Two of his most 
famous poems are a romantic novel in verse, <i>Rhodanthe and Dosikles</i>, and a mock-tragedy, 
<i>The Battle of Cats and Mice</i>.  He also wrote an assortment of treatises on theology, 
philosophy, and grammar, as well as dialogues and epistles.</p>
<p class="intro">Amid his less pious work, Prodromos wrote a set of quatrains on Biblical topics.  
One set is iambic stanzas in a simple, vulgar Greek; the other set is dactyclic stanzas, written 
in Homeric Greek.  The latter are, as may be guessed, harder to translate, especially with the 
more condensed and convoluted style.  I have decided, instead, to translate the stanzas in vulgar 
Greek.  Below are the quatrains Prodromos wrote on the topic of creation.</p>
<h2>Stanzas on Creation</h2>
<p class = "title">On the six-day work of God.</p>
<p class="poems">	In six days You made creation, O Word,
not too weak to make the world in a blink;
but so that, adding a seventh to six,
I would thus learn the Sabbath’s perfection.</p>
<p class = "title">On the creation of the world.</p>
<p class="poems">	O heaven and earth’s new builder, O Word,
first You covered, then fixed the unstable,
and You created earth after heaven,
and formed these by Your all-wise workmanship.</p>
<p class="title">On the firmament's creation.</p>
<p class="poems">	Yesterday you saw God heaven’s potter, host,
now see Him as heaven’s potter again.
What yesterday was empty, the first form,
the stars illuminate, the second form.</p>
<p class="title">On the “Let the earth bring forth plants and fruit-bearing trees.”</p>
<p class="poems">	Earth’s body You created naked, Word,
but now You clothe and dress in ornament,
with grasses, herbs, and every fruitful tree;
with a small word You cultivate each place.</p>
<p class="title">On the stars' creation.</p>
<p class="poems">	Yesterday’s fragments You gathered in light
today; they found a home, the solar disc.
The second of the two celestial spheres,
until now empty, is full-brimmed with stars.</p>
<p class="title">On the generation of swimming and flying creatures.</p>
<p class="poems">	The nature of the waters being soulless,
how did you make them souls conceive, O Word?
The flying, I say, and the swimming beasts.
All for the mystical reasons You know.</p>
<p class="title">On the forming of Adam.</p>
<p class="poems">	Earth’s son is Adam, earth’s prince, earth’s worker; 
produced, because his forming was of dust,
him You deemed worthy, as in God’s image,
and him You judged, most righteous punishment.</p>
<p class="title">On the forming of Eve.</p>
<p class="poems">	Is he asleep, or has he died, O host?
For he, whose rib entire has been removed,
You forced to sleep, the drama not to see.
Silence: God performs the woman’s forming.</p>
